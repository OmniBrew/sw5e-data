name: Lifted

* A lifted creature is <me-condition id="restrained"/>.
* The creature is <me-condition id="primed" sub="force"/>. Any detonating attack ends the lifted condition after resolving the
detonation effect.
* Any lifted object has no mass and is dangled in the air by a temporary Star Wars field. Thus, a lifted creature can be
pushed, pulled, or otherwise manipulated for varying results.
