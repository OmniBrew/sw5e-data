title: A Galaxy to Explore
---
The many worlds of the Star Wars 5th edition are places of tyranny and alien beasts, of brave fighters and spectacular adventures. They begin
with a foundation of science fiction and fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and mysteries that make these worlds unique.

Naturally, this conversion is designed to explore the myriad worlds of the Star Wars galaxy. The original writer, Galiphile, designed it to be used in the Old Republic era as characterized by the Knights of the Old Republic games and The Old Republic MMORPG. Utilizing this timeframe allows greater justification for a prevalence of force-wielders and many species that are extinct by the time of the Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga movies.

All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and species, fantastic geography, ancient ruins, and scheming villains. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the Separatists' war on Ord Mantell. Ultimately they're all Star Wars worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.

Your GM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of Star Wars, you should check with your GM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Game Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a canon world.

If you aren't familiar with the Star Wars universe, or looking to expand your knowledge, you can read about all major events and lore at on the Star Wars Wiki, __[Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)__. However the rich lore of the Star Wars universe is split between the current Canon universe and the older and far more diverse Legends universe. It is up to the Game Master to determine the era as well what lore they will pull from to create a Star Wars _"canon"_ of their own.

Specifically, the [Canon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history) and [Legends](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history/Legends) timelines, can get you quickly up to speed on the events of the galaxy.
