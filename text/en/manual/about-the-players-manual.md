_Star Wars 5e_ is an almost complete conversion for _Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition_ which allows you to play a tabletop roleplaying game
with _D&D5e_ rules but set in the _Star Wars_ universe. If you have played _5th edition_, many of the rules and rule syntaxes will feel familiar to you. For your convenience, completely new rules will be tagged with a <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip> badge. This indicates an entirely new rule or mechanic. Changes to rules will be tagged with a <v-chip color="warning" text-color="black" small>change</v-chip> badge. This indicates a rule change, augmentation, or extension.

For entirely new players (i.e., players who have not played _5th edition_), you will find the entirety of __5th edition's
System Reference Document__ (5e SRD) included in this homebrew. The purpose of including the SRD is to make it easier for
new and veteran players to reference the rules of _5th edition_ when using this homebrew.

Since _D&D 5th edition_ is primarily focused on a fantasy setting, the components of the SRD have been "reskinned." Where,
the SRD may reference an orc, kingdom, or galley, this version will reference a trooper, planet, or starship. However, you
can also read through the _[official 5e SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)_. We also highly suggest 
using the _D&D5e Dungeon Master's Guide_ for any Game Master looking to expand their campaign.

#### Vernacular
In _Star Wars 5e_, much of the classic fantasy vernacular has been updated to fit the _Star Wars_ setting.

- Dungeon Master = Game Master
- Races = Species
- Spells = Powers
- Mundane = Unenhanced
- Magic, Magic Item, Magical = Enhanced, Enhanced Item
- Currency = Credits. Credits are often abbriviated to cr. Conversion from D&D5e to SW5e, 1 sp = 1 cr, 1 gp = 10 cr.
