__Star Wars 5e__ is ann almost complete conversion for __Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition__ which allows you to play a tabletop roleplaying game
with __D&D5e__ rules but set in the __Star Wars__ universe. If you have played __5th edition__, many of the rules and rule syntaxes will feel familiar to you. For your convenience, completely new rules will be tagged with a <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip> badge. This indicates an entirely new rule or mechanic. Changes to rules will be tagged with a <v-chip color="warning" text-color="black" small>change</v-chip> badge. This indicates a rule change, augmentation, or extension.

For entirely new players (i.e., players who have not played __5th edition__), you will find the entirety of __5th edition's
System Reference Document__ (5e SRD) included in this homebrew. The purpose of including the SRD is to make it easier for
new and veteran players to reference the rules of __5th edition__ when using this homebrew.

Since __D&D 5th edition__ is primarily focused on a fantasy setting, the components of the SRD have been "reskinned." Where,
the SRD may reference an orc, kingdom, or galley, this version will reference a trooper, planet, or starship. However, you
can also read through the __[official 5e SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)__. We also highly suggest 
using the __D&D5e Dungeon Master's Guide__ for any Game Master looking to expand their campaign.

#### Vernacular
In __Star Wars 5e__, much of the classic fantasy vernacular has been updated to fit the __Star Wars__ setting.

- Dungeon Master = Game Master
- Races = Species
- Spells = Powers
- Mundane = Unenhanced
- Magic, Magic Item, Magical = Enhanced, Enhanced Item
- Currency = Credits. Credits are often abbriviated to cr. Conversion from D&D5e to SW5e, 1 sp = 1 cr, 1 gp = 10 cr.
