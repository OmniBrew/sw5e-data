title: What is a Power?
---
There isn't any traditional fantasy "magic" in Star Wars 5e but there are super-powered abilities, advanced technology,
and fantastic items. Star Wars 5e retains the word "power" as a catch-all to describe special powers that are available
to the game's classes.

Powers can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions,
drain life energy away, and restore health to the injured.
