If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Its AC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the <em>mending</em> tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest.

Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs.

Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller.

Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures.

The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet.

The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn.</p>\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high.

You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wearing medium or heavy armor with which you are proficient, you can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, damage dealt to you by the target is reduced by an amount equal to half your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of one) while marked. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to avoid being moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disruption Style.</strong> Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You are skilled at fighting and interfering with casters of the chosen type.

You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you can use your bonus action to feint.

On a success, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against them before the start of your next turn.</li>\n<li>While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, when you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.</li>\n<li>Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Equilibrium Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting without the confines of armor. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wearing light or no armor and not wielding a shield, you can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, you gain a bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against effects the target controls equal to half your Dexterity modifier (minimum of +1) while marked. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explosives Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting with explosives. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can throw grenades and set mines with your bonus action, instead of your action. If you could already throw grenades and set mines as a bonus action, you can instead do so as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against a grenade, mine, or missile you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Formation Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting with a partner. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can take the Guard action as a bonus action.

The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of you, and this movement can't exceed the ally's speed.</li>\n<li>When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Formfighting Style.</strong> <em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The ability to cast force powers</em>\nYou are skilled at the basics of the known forms of lightsaber combat. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You learn three lightsaber forms, detailed later in this chapter.</li>\n<li>Once on each of your turns, you can draw or stow a lightweapon without using your object interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Great Weapon Style.</strong> You are skilled at putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wielding a two-handed light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, your weapon damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.</li>\n<li>Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Guerrilla Style.</strong> You are skilled at maneuvering across the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Disengage action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When you take the Disengage action, you ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and you have advantage on the first ability check or saving throw to avoid an effect that impairs your movement speed or forces you to move before the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gunning Style.</strong> You are skilled at using blasters in unique ways. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against your burst or rapid property, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.</li>\n<li>When you use the burst property of a weapon, you can instead spray a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide within range with shots.</li>\n<li>When you use the rapid property of a weapon, when you roll the weapon's damage dice twice, you can double one set of the weapon's damage dice and forgo the other instead of adding them together.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mounted Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting while mounted. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mounting a vehicle or beast only uses 5 feet of your movement, provided you can reach it.</li>\n<li>You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead, provided you are a valid target for that attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Onslaught Style.</strong> You are skilled at using your momentum to your advantage.

Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. This effects ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.</p>\n<p>This die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.<em><strong>Flood.</strong></em> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Part Water.</strong></em> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong></em> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Whirlpool.</strong></em> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\n",

If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required). The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.</p>\n",
