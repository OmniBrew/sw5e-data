You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can take the Help action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Help action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>Creatures benefiting from your Help action can't have disadvantage on the affected ability check or attack roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Berserk Style.</strong> You are skilled at returning pain to those who deliver it. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you deal additional damage equal to your Strength modifier if that creature dealt damage to you since the start of your last turn.</li>\n<li>When you choose to let an attack that would miss you hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Blindfighting Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting without sight. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. If you already have blindsight, it instead increases by 10 feet.</li>\n<li>You can use your bonus action to double the range of your blindsight until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Brawler Style.</strong> You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are proficient with improvised weapons.</li>\n<li>Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).</li>\n<li>When you take the Attack action and attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature, or make an attack against a creature with an unarmed strike or a weapon wielded in one hand on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, grapple, shove, or trip against the same creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Counterstrike Style.</strong> You are skilled at returning attacks at those who dare strike you. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you would provoke an opportunity attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to force the creature to make the opportunity attack, if it can.</li>\n<li>Creatures who make opportunity attacks against you provoke opportunity attacks from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Covert Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting from unseen angles.

You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wearing medium or heavy armor with which you are proficient, you can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, damage dealt to you by the target is reduced by an amount equal to half your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of one) while marked. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to avoid being moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disruption Style.</strong> Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You are skilled at fighting and interfering with casters of the chosen type. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you force a creature to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on your turn, and they succeed on the save, you can use your bonus action to force them to reroll the save. They must use the new roll.</li>\n<li>Once per round, when a hostile creature attempts to cast a power while within 5 feet of you, they must first make a Constitution saving throw as if to maintain concentration (DC = 10 + the power's level). On a failure, the power isn't cast and any points are wasted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dual Wield Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting with two weapons.

You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you can use your bonus action to feint.

On a success, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against them before the start of your next turn.</li>\n<li>While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, when you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.</li>\n<li>Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Equilibrium Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting without the confines of armor. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wearing light or no armor and not wielding a shield, you can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, you gain a bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against effects the target controls equal to half your Dexterity modifier (minimum of +1) while marked. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explosives Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting with explosives. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can throw grenades and set mines with your bonus action, instead of your action. If you could already throw grenades and set mines as a bonus action, you can instead do so as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against a grenade, mine, or missile you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Formation Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting with a partner. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can take the Guard action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Guard action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When you move on your turn, you can use a bonus action to allow a willing ally within 5 feet of you to move with you (no action required by the ally). The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of you, and this movement can't exceed the ally's speed.</li>\n<li>When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Formfighting Style.</strong> <em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The ability to cast force powers</em>\nYou are skilled at the basics of the known forms of lightsaber combat. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You learn three lightsaber forms, detailed later in this chapter.</li>\n<li>Once on each of your turns, you can draw or stow a lightweapon without using your object interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Great Weapon Style.</strong> You are skilled at putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you are wielding a two-handed light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, your weapon damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.</li>\n<li>Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Guerrilla Style.</strong> You are skilled at maneuvering across the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Disengage action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When you take the Disengage action, you ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and you have advantage on the first ability check or saving throw to avoid an effect that impairs your movement speed or forces you to move before the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gunning Style.</strong> You are skilled at using blasters in unique ways. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against your burst or rapid property, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.</li>\n<li>When you use the burst property of a weapon, you can instead spray a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide within range with shots.</li>\n<li>When you use the rapid property of a weapon, when you roll the weapon's damage dice twice, you can double one set of the weapon's damage dice and forgo the other instead of adding them together.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mounted Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting while mounted. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mounting a vehicle or beast only uses 5 feet of your movement, provided you can reach it.</li>\n<li>You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead, provided you are a valid target for that attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Onslaught Style.</strong> You are skilled at using your momentum to your advantage.

If you could already take the Dash action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When you would make an ability check to attempt to shove or trip a creature, you can make a melee weapon attack against the target's AC instead of a contested check. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack roll with advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Poisoner Style.</strong> You are skilled at with the subtlety of poisons. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can apply poisons with your bonus action, instead of your action. If you could already apply poisons as a bonus action, you can instead do so as a reaction on your turn.</li>\n<li>When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against a poison you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secured Style.</strong> You are skilled at fighting with weapons in atypical places. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the start of each of your turns while wielding a fixed weapon, you can choose to treat the weapon as a light shield until the start of your next turn.
