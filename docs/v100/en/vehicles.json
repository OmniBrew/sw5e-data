    "html": "<p>The Gunship is driven by vectored-thrust engines. First rolled off the assembly lines in 2170, the Mantis remains in\nservice in dozens of armies across the galaxy. Its modular construction means that the versatile Mantis can be\nreconfigured as a low-altitude gunship, a fighter, a high-altitude bomber, or even a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane\nthat can engage enemy craft around a planet or a space station. The only role the Mantis cannot perform is that of a true\ndeep-space fighter, as it has no FTL drive.</p>\n<p>This vehicle statblock represents the most basic model of the A-61. But it can carry a number of weapons load-outs. When\nused in ground-attack roles it is most commonly armed with two sets of two forward-facing missile bays over each wing,\nnormally armed with Inferno PKRs (Precision Kill Rockets), and a pair of belly-mounted M350 mass-accelerator autocannons.</p>\n",
