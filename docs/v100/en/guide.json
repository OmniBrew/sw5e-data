Below you'll\nfind a list of mechanics used in this system.</p>\n<h3>Rule exception/addition</h3>\n<p>The first step is deciding what you want your mechanic to do, e.g. add health, shields, or damage; provide advantage on\nsaving throws, etc. <strong>We strongly recommend that you do not make new mechanics that increase the combat effectiveness of ranged weapons.\nThese mechanics should be reserved for weapon mods.</strong></p>\n<h3>Potency</h3>\n<p>Next, decide how the mechanic's potency will stack. For example, increased shield points have 5 points per potency.\nSo, an Armor Mod with +10 shield points would have a potency of 2. Armor Mods should never have a potency higher than 3.\nKeep this in mind when figuring out the lowest potency amount.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>Figuring out the cost is mostly guesswork. Low-cost mechanics have minor combat applications, such as additional\ncarrying capacity or minor speed boosts. These range from 1,000 to 5,000 credits. Mods that increase survivability\n(shields, AC, resistances) or damage should range between 5,000 and 20,000 credits</p>\n<h3>List of Mechanics</h3>\n<v-simple-table class=\"mb-8\"><template v-slot:default><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule Exception</th>\n<th>Potency</th>\n<th>Cost per Potency</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase AC</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>20000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reroll any 1 and 2 on your (biotic, tech, or melee) damage rolls</td>\n<td>1 damage type</td>\n<td>40000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Advantage on skill check</td>\n<td>1 skill type</td>\n<td>15000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+X to melee weapon attack and damage rolls</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use medi-gel as a reaction to taking hit point damage</td>\n<td>1 medi-gel charge</td>\n<td>8000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instantly stabilize when you drop below 0 hit points.</td>\n<td>1 per long rest</td>\n<td>35000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>When subjected to an effect that lets you make a saving throw to take half damage, take no damage on a success.</td>\n<td>1 saving throw type</td>\n<td>45000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increases one ability score by 1-5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>33000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Condition Immunity</td>\n<td>1 condition</td>\n<td>35000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reroll any 1 on your (biotic, tech, or melee) damage rolls</td>\n<td>1 damage type</td>\n<td>20000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Damage immunity</td>\n<td>1 damage type</td>\n<td>55000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Darkvision up to certain distance.
