    "html": "<p>In early 2017, I began listening to <a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone\" target=\"_blank\">The Adventure Zone</a>\nand became intrigued by D&amp;D 5th edition. <!--more--> Quick, tangential shout-out: if I threw in all my favorite books, music, movies,\netc into sorted list, TAZ would rank in the top 10. Seriously, you should be listening to it.</p>\n<p>You're probably wondering, &quot;How is it 2017 and you've not played 5th Edition?&quot;. Well I'm not a very experience TRPG'er.\nUp to this point I'd only gamed within Pinnacle's <a href=\"https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/\" target=\"_blank\">Savage Worlds</a> system.\nSo after a few episodes of TAZ, I got myself a 5e player's handbook and read that mofo cover to cover. What I enjoyed\nmost was the de-emphasis of strategic tabletop battling and the emphasis of creative problem-solving. Plus the simplicity\nof the die rolling was appealing:</p>\n<p><code>D20 + modifying_numbers &gt; target_number ? success : failure</code></p>\n<p>Though the game certainly gets more complicated, the base equation is simple enough for inexperienced players to wrap\ntheir heads around.</p>\n<p>Now, I enjoy a fantasy setting as much as the next nerd, but I'd pick sci-fi over fantasy nine times out of ten. And what's\njust came out? That's right...<a href=\"https://www.masseffect.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>. Mass Effect is one of my favorite sci-fi\nuniverses but it's got another key feature: the wizard, i.e., spellcasting. Plus, you have an entire <em>universe</em> to run a\ncampaign. You can focus on space exploration, fighting Reapers, policing the Milky Way, or mixing with the Citadel politics.</p>\n<p>So I got this crazy idea, <em>I want to play a TRPG Mass Effect</em>.\nMy current DM said, &quot;I think there are a few out there already.&quot; And, yeah, I found a few in various states of completion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete Works\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://masseffectd6.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect D6</a>, a Star Wars D6 conversion</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150629183534/http://masseffectrpg.org/wp/?page_id=51\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect Fate RPG</a>, a FATE conversion</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5c7osZJmQnvQ09YVHFNaXdSLVk/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect d20 system</a>, a OGL d20 conversion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Mass:_the_Effecting\" target=\"_blank\">Mass: the Effecting</a>, a nWoD conversion</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pegforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=35981\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Effect: Ascension</a>, a Savage Worlds conversion</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rpgcrank.blogspot.com/p/savage-worlds-mass-effect.html\" target=\"_blank\">Savage Worlds: Mass Effect</a>, Savage Worlds again.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://destination-zero.obsidianportal.com/wikis/mass-effect-conversion-rules\" target=\"_blank\">A Mass Effect Game for Traveller</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I even found the beginnings of a <a href=\"https://edster504.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">5e conversion</a>. Perhaps I'm stubborn, or perhaps I'm\na masochist, or perhaps these other options just don't have that 5e flair I crave. No matter the reason, I've take the\nplunge, and that is how it starts.</p>\n",
