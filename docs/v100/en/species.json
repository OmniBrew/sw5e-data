As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings.

Noted for their thick, wrinkled skin which can resist most physical attacks and their shuffling gait, the large-headed race have no obvious differences between male and female baragwin. An acute sense of smell give the species enough sensitivity to detect another being’s mood and feelings. This leads some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-baragwin believe the race to be a dull-witted people while, in fact, they are quite intelligent.

Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin are famous as skilled weapon-smiths and introduced many different weapons to different worlds. Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades are among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy.</p>\n<me-tpg e=\"div\" s=\"h3\">NAMES</me-tpg><me-hr size=\"1\" class=\"mb-2\"/><p>Baragwin have names with wide tones, spoken using the entire mouth, that don’t differentiate by gender.

Children are left behind by their families at a very young age and must learn to fend for themselves. Because of this, those who quickly learned hunting skills survived. Their size and strength made them prized as hired muscle, but most Dowutins’ pride dissuaded them from such work, as they viewed other species as weak, absolutely refusing to take orders from anyone who is physically weaker than them. As such, those who employ Dowutin will command them in more subtle ways, typically phrasing their commands as suggestions or advice.

The species’ two arms consist of feathered wings ending in nimble humanoid hands, capable of manipulating tools. The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species. A Rishii’s head contained a beak between two yellow eyes framed by a large brow.

Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders’ choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.</p>\n<me-tpg e=\"div\" s=\"h3\">NAMES</me-tpg><me-hr size=\"1\" class=\"mb-2\"/><p>As with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them.

In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation.

It is possible that some aspects of these individuals’ appearances are not from their theelin genes, but from other near-human ancestors. Most, however, have vividly colored hair and pale skin, often mottled with colorful spots. Unfortunately, a series of mutations arose among later generations of theelin. These mutations have led to genetic incompatibilities within their species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue their species by cross-breeding with other near-humans could not stop the theelin slide towards extinction, due to the high infant mortality rates such couplings suffer from. Theelin began inevitably dwindling in number only a few million theelin and part-theelin remain by the time the Republic fell, and pure theelin are presumed extinct by the fall of the Empire.

They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon.

The most striking of these are\na series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both\nmales and females. These horns grow at puberty in\nvarying patterns and signified that their rite of passage\nis drawing near.\nIn addition to their horns, another of the traits that\nmake zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial\ntattoos, which are made up of thin lines received\nduring their rite of passage. These could symbolize\nmany things, including but not limited to family lineage,\nplace of birth, or even a design that reflected their\nindividual personalities.\nLastly, zabraks possess a second heart.</p>\n<me-tpg e=\"div\" s=\"h3\">SOCIETY AND CULTURE</me-tpg><me-hr size=\"1\" class=\"mb-2\"/><p>Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being\nsingle-minded, an observation that is not terribly\nincorrect. This single-minded determination comes\nfrom the fact that they are a species with a strong\nsense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able\nto accomplish any task that they set out to do.\nHowever, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a\nsense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it\nis not uncommon to see competition between\ncolonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks\nbelieve that the various experiences of the different\ncolonies only serve to add to the species' overall value\nthroughout the galaxy.</p>\n<me-tpg e=\"div\" s=\"h3\">NAMES</me-tpg><me-hr size=\"1\" class=\"mb-2\"/><p>Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals\nliving on their planet.

They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.</p>\n<me-tpg e=\"div\" s=\"h3\">SOCIETY AND CULTURE</me-tpg><me-hr size=\"1\" class=\"mb-2\"/><p>Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire.
