Alternatively, you can\ncreate one of the following e􀃠ects of your choice:\nYou summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in\nvalue that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no\nmore than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in\nan unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\nYou allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to\nregain all hit points, and you end all e􀃠ects on them\ndescribed in the improved restoration power.\nYou grant up to ten creatures that you can see\nresistance to a damage type you choose.\nYou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to\na single power or other speci􀃕c enhanced e􀃠ect for 8\nhours. For instance, you could make yourself and all\nyour companions immune to the Manifestation of\nAbeloth's Will ability.\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of\nany roll made within the last round (including your last\nturn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new\nresult. For example, will of the force could undo an\nopponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a\nfriend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made\nwith advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose\nwhether to use the reroll or the original roll.\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the\nscope of the above examples. State your wish to the\nDM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude\nin ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater\nthe wish, the greater the likelihood that something\ngoes wrong. This power might simply fail, the e􀃠ect\nyou desire might only be partly achieved, or you might\nsu􀃠er some unforeseen consequence as a result of\nhow you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a\nvillain were dead might propel you forward in time to a\nperiod when that villain is no longer alive, e􀃠ectively\nremoving you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a\nlegendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly\ntransport you to the presence of the item's current\nowner.\nThe stress of casting this power to produce any\ne􀃠ect other than duplicating another power weakens\nyou. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a\npower until you 􀃕nish a long rest, you take 1d10\nnecrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be\nreduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your\nStrength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4\ndays. For each of those days that you spend resting\nand doing nothing more than light activity, your\nremaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.\nAdditionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are\nunable to cast will of the force ever again if you su􀃠er\nthis stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as\na result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before\nyou have fully recovered from the Strength reduction,\nyou immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your\nbody fades away, absorbed into the living Force.</p>\n",
