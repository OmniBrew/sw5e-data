If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another power, this power ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.</p>\n<p>While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p>\n<p>The target's mind fills in any gaps in the altered memory. If the power ends before you have finished prescribing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the power ends.</p>\n<p>A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how the target behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the target's core programming, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the target enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a glitch. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a target in a significant manner.</p>\n<p>A <em>remove virus</em> or similar power cast on the target restores its true memory.</p>\n<p><em><strong><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>:</strong></em> If you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).</p>\n",

    "html": "<p>You sublimate yourself before the will of the Force, attempting to use it to affect change in the galaxy around you.</p>\n<p>The basic use of this power is to duplicate any other light side or universal force power of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that power; it simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in value that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the <em>improved restoration</em> power.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other specific enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, <em>will of the force</em> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude</p>\n<p>in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n<p>The stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>will of the force</em> ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.</p>\n",
