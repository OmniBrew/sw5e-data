You imbue a willing droid with heightened speed and maneuverability. Until the power ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, and it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws. 

***__At Higher Levels__:*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional droid for each slot level above 2nd.
