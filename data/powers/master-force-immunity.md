A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier
surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast
and enhanced items become mundane. Until the
power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on
you.
Powers and other enhanced e􀃠ects are suppressed
in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot
expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed.
While an e􀃠ect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but
the time it spends suppressed counts against its
duration.
Targeted Effects. Powers and other enhanced
e􀃠ects that target a creature or an object in the sphere
have no e􀃠ect on that target.
Enhanced Areas. The area of another power or
enhanced e􀃠ect, such as force storm, can't extend into
the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area,
the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
suppressed.
Powers. Any active power or other enhanced e􀃠ect
on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed
while the creature or object is in it.
Enhanced Items. The properties and powers of
enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an
unenhanced vibrosword.
An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere
or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced
weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully
leaves the sphere (for example, if you 􀃕re an enhanced
shot or throw an enhanced saberspear at a target
outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item
ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Enhanced Travel. Teleportation fails to work in the
sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the
departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to
another location temporarily closes while in the
sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
summoned or created by powers temporarily winks
out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature
instantly reappears once the space the creature
occupied is no longer within the sphere.
Tech Override/Sever Force. Powers and enhanced
e􀃠ects such as sever force have no e􀃠ect on the
sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by di􀃠erent
scrambling 􀃕eld powers don't nullify each other.
