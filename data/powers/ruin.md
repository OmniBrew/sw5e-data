You channel the dark side of the Force to desecrate a
creature you can see within range, causing waves of
intense pain to assail it. If the target has 100 hit points
or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the
power has no e􀃠ect on it.
While the target is a􀃠ected by crippling pain, any
speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target
also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks,
and saving throws, other than Constitution saving
throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a power, it
must 􀃕rst succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or
the casting fails and the power is wasted.
A target su􀃠ering this pain can make a Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a
successful save, the pain ends.
