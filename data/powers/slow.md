A hostile creature of your choice must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target
gains 1 slowed level until the power ends. At the end of
each of the creature's turns, it repeats this saving
throw, ending the e􀃠ect on a success.
This power can a􀃠ect multiple targets when you
reach higher levels: two targets at 5th level, three
targets at 11th level, and four targets at 17th level.
