Through the Force, you gain a limited form of telepathy that enables you to anticipate the moves of your opponents in combat. While you arenâ€™t wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +2 AC bonus against melee attacks and a +3 AC bonus against ranged attacks.

This AC bonus is not applied against attacks from droids, constructs, or creatures with resistance or immunity to psychic damage.
