You use the Force to produce an e􀃠ect within range.
You create one of the following special e􀃠ects within
range:
Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal,
and you can alter its tone, for 1 minute.
You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1
minute.
You create an instantaneous sound that originates
from a point of your choice within range, such as a
rumble of thunder, the cry of a bird, or ominous
whispers.
You gain the ability to speak like another species for 1
minute, allowing you to speak in a language you know
but otherwise lack the physical ability to speak, such as
a Wookiee speaking Basic.
You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory e􀃠ect,
such as falling leaves, a pu􀃠 of wind, a billowing of
someone's clothes, or a 􀃖ickering of unenhanced light
􀃕xtures within range.
A wary creature can use its action to make an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force
save DC, discerning that the e􀃠ects are illusory on a
success.
If you cast this power multiple times, you can have
up to three of its 1-minute e􀃠ects active at a time, and
you can dismiss such an e􀃠ect as an action.
