A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of
your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in
a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each
target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your
forcecasting ability modifier. This power has no effect
on droids or constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases
by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
