You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of
casting a force power. If the creature is casting a power
of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no e􀃠ect. If
it is casting a power of 4th level or higher, make an
ability check using your forcecasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the
creature's power fails and has no e􀃠ect.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted power
has no e􀃠ect if its level is less than or equal to the level
of the force slot you used.
