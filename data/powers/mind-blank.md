Until the power ends, one willing creature you touch
is immune to psychic and sonic damage, any e􀃠ect that
would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, and the
charmed condition. The power foils powers or e􀃠ects
of similar power used to a􀃠ect the target's mind or to
gain information about the target.
