If you cast this power using 1 action, all normal
plants in a 100-foot radius centered on a point become
overgrown. Moving through the area spends 4 feet of
movement for every 1 foot moved. You can exclude
areas of any size within the power's area from being
aô€ƒ ected.
If you cast this power over 8 hours, all plants in a
half-mile radius centered on a point yield twice the
normal amount of food when harvested for 1 year.
