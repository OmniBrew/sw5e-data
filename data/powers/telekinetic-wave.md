You manipulate the Force in a 60-foot radius
centered on a point you choose within range. Each
creature in that area must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 force
damage, is knocked prone, and moved 5 feet in a
direction of your choice. On a successful save, it takes
half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or
moved.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 9th level, the damage increases by 2d6.
