You choose one object that you must touch
throughout the casting of the power. If it is an
enhanced or modi􀃕ed item, you learn its properties
and how to use them, whether it requires attunement
to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn
whether any powers are a􀃠ecting the item and what
they are.
If the item was created by a power, you learn which
power created it. If you instead touch a creature
throughout the casting, you learn what force powers, if
any, are currently a􀃠ecting it.
