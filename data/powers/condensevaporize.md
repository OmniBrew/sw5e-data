In an open container, you can create up to 10 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog. 

***__At Higher Levels__:*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the amount of water you can create increases by 10 gallons, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.
