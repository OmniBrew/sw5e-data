You cause a minor effect within range. Choose one of the following:
- Your natural voice booms up to three times louder than normal for 1 minute. You can also alter the sound of your voice to achieve a certain effect--to sound more intimidating, for example.
- You cause unenhanced electronic lights to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
- You create a sound within range for up to 1 minute. The sound can range in volume from a whisper to a scream.
- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
- You create an illusory image of an object no larger than a 5 foot cube. The illusion is purely visual.

If you cast this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

A creature that witnesses the effects of this power can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. On a successful check, the creature discerns that the effects are illusory, and they become faint to the creature.

The maximum number of active effects increases by 3 when you reach 5th level (6), 11th level (9), and 17th level (12).
