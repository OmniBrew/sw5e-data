This power massively bolsters your allies with
toughness and resolve. Creatures of your choice in a
30-foot radius around you when you cast this power
gain the following beneô€ƒ•ts:
The creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius.
The creature has advantage on all saving throws
Other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls
against them.
When a dark side creature hits them with a melee
attack, that creature must make a Constitution saving
throw or be blinded until the power ends.
