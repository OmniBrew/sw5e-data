Choose a droid or construct that you can see within
range. The target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the
beginning of each of its turns, the target takes energy
damage equal to your forcecasting ability modiô€ƒ•er. At
the end of each of its turns, the target can make
another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the
power ends on the target.
