You suggest a course of activity (limited to a
sentence or two) and in􀃖uence with the Force up to
twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within
range and that can hear and understand you.
Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this
e􀃠ect. The suggestion must be worded in such a
manner as to make the course of action sound
reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself
automatically negates the e􀃠ect of the power.
Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you
described to the best of its ability. The suggested
course of action can continue for the entire duration. If
the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
time, the power ends when the subject 􀃕nishes what it
was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a
special activity during the duration. For example, you
might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their
money to the 􀃕rst beggar they meet. If the condition
isn't met before the power ends, the activity isn't
performed. If you or any of your companions damage
a creature a􀃠ected by this power, the power ends for
that creature. This power has no e􀃠ect on droids or
constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
7th-level force slot, the duration is 10 days. When you
use an 8th-level force slot, the duration is 30 days.
When you use a 9th-level force slot, the duration is a
year and a day.
