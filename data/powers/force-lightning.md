A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and
5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you
choose. Each creature in the line must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area
that aren't being worn or carried.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
