You select a weapon or object being worn or carried
by a Large or smaller creature within range. The
creature must make a Strength or Dexterity saving
throw (the creature chooses the ability to use). If the
item is being carried, this save is made with advantage.
On a failed save, the item is pulled directly to you. If
you have a free hand, you catch the weapon.
Otherwise, it lands at your feet.
