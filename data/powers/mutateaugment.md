You alter your body with tech, temporarily gaining new properties which last for the duration. You can select three of the following properties. You cannot select a property more than once, unless that property says otherwise.
- Your body becomes more flexible. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would grapple or restrain you, and your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain or squeezing.
- You grow one additional appendage. This appendage serves as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of a limb, tentacle, or similar appendage. You can select this property twice to grow a maximum number of two appendages. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).
- You sprout antennae that give you tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.
- You extend the length of your limbs. When you make a melee attack or attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
- You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed.
- Your flesh hardens. Your AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you're wearing.
- You can gain the benefits of any one option of the _alter self_ power. You can select this property multiple times to gain the benefits of multiple options of the _alter self_ power, choosing a different option each time.
- You gain the effect of the _magnetic hold_ power, but you can affix to and move along any surface, instead of only metallic surfaces. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can gain any one effect of the _force enlightenment_ power.

***__At Higher Levels__:*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you can select an additional property for each slot level above 3rd.
