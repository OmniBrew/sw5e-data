You choose a point within range and cause psychic
energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-footradius sphere centered on that point must make an
Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an
Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this
power. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts
for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and
subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and
ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws
to maintain concentration. The target can make an
Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
