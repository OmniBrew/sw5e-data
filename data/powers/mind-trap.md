You attempt to trap the mind of your target in a
psychic cage. The target must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated
for the duration as its mind is trapped. It can think, but
it can't have any contact with or perceive the outside
world. If the creature takes damage, it makes another
Charisma save. On a success, the power ends. This
power has no eô€ƒ ect on droids or constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 6th level or higher, after 1 minute of
concentration the power's duration becomes 24 hours
and it no longer requires your concentration.
