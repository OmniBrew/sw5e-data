You curse an opponent within range. Until the power
ends, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the
target whenever you hit it with an attack. Also, choose
one ability when you cast the power. The target has
disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen
ability.
If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power
ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn
of yours to curse a new creature.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your
concentration on the power for up to 8 hours. When
you use a force slot of 5th level or higher, you can
maintain your concentration on the power for up to 24
hours.
