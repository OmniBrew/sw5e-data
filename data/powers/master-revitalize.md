You return a dead creature you touch to life,
provided that it has been dead no longer than 1 day. If
the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to
rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with all its
hit points. This power has no e􀃠ect on droids or
constructs.
This power closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison,
cures all diseases, and lifts any curses a􀃠ecting the
creature when it died. The power replaces damaged or
missing organs and limbs.
