Purifying energy radiates from you in a 30-foot
radius. Until the power ends, the aura moves with you,
centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura
(including you) can't become diseased, has resistance
to poison damage, and has advantage on saving
throws against effects that cause any of the following
conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened,
paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.
