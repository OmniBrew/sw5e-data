You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst
fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding
and become frightened for the duration. This power
has no effect on constructs or droids.
While frightened by this power, a creature must take
the Dash action and move away from you by the safest
available route on each of its turns, unless there is
nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a
location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the
creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the power ends for that creature.
