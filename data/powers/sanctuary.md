Until the power ends, any creature who targets the
warded creature with an attack, a harmful power, or a
hostile action must 􀃕rst make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature must choose a new
target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't
protect the warded creature from area e􀃠ects.
If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a
power that a􀃠ects an enemy creature, or takes a
hostile action this power ends.
