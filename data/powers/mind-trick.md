Choose a target within range that isn't hostile toward
you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
On a successful save, the creature realizes that you
tried to use the Force to in􀃖uence its awareness and
becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to
violence might attack you. Another creature might seek
retribution in other ways (at the GM's discretion),
depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
This power has no e􀃠ect on droids or constructs.
