You lift three piles of debris or small objects from the
ground and hurl them. Each pile hits a creature of your
choice that you can see within range. The pile deals
1d4+1 force damage to its target. The piles all strike
simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one
creature or several.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, you lift and throw an
additional pile of debris for each slot level above 1st.
