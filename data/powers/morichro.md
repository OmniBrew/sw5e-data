You touch a willing creature and put it into a
cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.
For the power's duration, or until you use an action
to touch the target and dismiss the power, the target
appears dead to all outward inspection and to powers
used to determine the target's status. The target is
blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0.
The target has resistance to all damage except psychic
damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you
cast the power, or becomes diseased or poisoned
while under the power's e􀃠ect, the disease and poison
have no e􀃠ect until the power ends. This power has no
e􀃠ect on droids or constructs.
