This power lets you distract a beast. Choose a beast
that you can see within range. If the beast's Intelligence
is 4 or higher, the power fails. Otherwise, the beast
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed by you for the power's duration. If you or one
of your companions harms the target, the power ends.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one
additional beast for each slot level above 1st.
