You summon a 20-foot-radius sphere of inky
blackness at a point within range. No light, enhanced
or otherwise, can illuminate the area, creatures fully
within the area are blinded, and the area is difficult
terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area
takes 2d6 necrotic damage. Any creature that ends its
turn in the area must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or take 2d6 poison damage as tendrils of dark
energy caress it.
