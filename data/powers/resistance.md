You touch one willing creature. Once before the
power ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the
number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can
roll the die before or after the saving throw. The power
then ends.
This power's die increases at higher levels: to a d6 at
5th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 17th level.
