Using the Force to augment the strength in your legs,
you leap up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can
see, provided you have a direct path to the space.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, your jump distance
increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.
