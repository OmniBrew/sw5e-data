You boost yourself through the air with a brief surge of repulsor energy. You can rise a number of feet equal to 20 x your techcasting ability modifier. You can also move a number of feet horizontally during any part of the movement equal to 5 x your techcasting ability modifier. At the end of the turn on which you cast this power, you float gently to the ground if you are still aloft.

***__At Higher Levels__:*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can rise an additional 20 feet, and move horizontally by another 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.
