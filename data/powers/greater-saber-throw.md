As a part of the action used to cast this power, you
must make a ranged force attack with a lightweapon or
vibroweapon against one target within the power's
range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target
takes 6d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's
damage and must make a Constitution saving throw
against an additional effect depending on your choice
of casting ability:
Wisdom. The target takes an additional 4d6 force
damage and it gains four levels of slowed until the end
of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as
much damage and its speed isn't reduced.
Charisma. The target takes an additional 4d6
necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the
end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half
as much damage and its healing capability is
unaffected.
The weapon then immediately returns to your hand.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 6th level or higher, the force or necrotic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 5th.
