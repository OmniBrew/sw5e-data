A creature of your choice that you can see within
range is overcome with a sense of dizziness and
nausea, as you disturb its equilibrium with the Force.
The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall
prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up
for the duration.
At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes
damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving
throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if
it's triggered by damage. On a success, the power
ends. This power has no eô€ƒ ect on droids or constructs.
