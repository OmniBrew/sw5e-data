You endow yourself with endurance and martial
prowess fueled by the Force. Until the power ends, you
can't cast powers, and you gain the following bene􀃕ts:
You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these
remain when the power ends, they are lost.
You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with
lightweapons and vibroweapons.
When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target
takes an extra 2d12 force damage.
You have pro􀃕ciency with all armor, lightweapons, and
vibroweapons.
You have pro􀃕ciency in Strength and Constitution
saving throws.
You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take
the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this bene􀃕t if
you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives
you extra attacks.
Immediately after the power ends, you must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or su􀃠er one
level of exhaustion.
