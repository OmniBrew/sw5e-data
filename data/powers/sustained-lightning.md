You lash out against a creature within range with
continual jolts of Force lightning. Make a ranged force
attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes
1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for
the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12
lightning damage to the target automatically. The
power ends if you use your action to do anything else.
The power also ends if the target is ever outside the
power's range or if it has total cover from you.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.
