You attune your senses to pick up the emotions of
others for the duration. When you cast the power, and
as your action on each turn until the power ends, you
can focus your senses on one humanoid you can see
within 30 feet of you. You instantly learn the target's
prevailing emotion, whether it's love, anger, pain, fear,
calm, or something else, and you have advantage on
Wisdom (Insight) checks against the target. If the target
isn't actually humanoid or it is immune to being
charmed, you sense that it is calm.
