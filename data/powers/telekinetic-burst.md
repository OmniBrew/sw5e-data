A beam of Force energy ô€ƒ–ashes out from your hand
in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the
line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 8d6 force damage and is
knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as
much damage and isn't knocked prone.
You can create a new telekinetic gust as your action
on your turn until the power ends.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases
by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.
