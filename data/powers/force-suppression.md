Choose one creature, object, or force effect within
range. Any force power of 3rd level or lower on the
target ends. For each force power of 4th level or higher
on the target, make an ability check using your
forcecasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's
level. On a success, the power ends.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end
the effects of a force power on the target if the power's
level is equal to or less than the level of the force slot
you used.
