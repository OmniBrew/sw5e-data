You stir the Force around you, creating a turbulent
􀃕eld of telekinetic energy that bu􀃠ets enemies around
you. The 􀃕eld extends out to a distance of 15 feet
around you for the duration.
When you cast this power, you can designate any
number of creatures you can see to be una􀃠ected by
it. An a􀃠ected creature gains 1 slowed level while in the
area, and when the creature enters the area for the
􀃕rst time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature takes 3d8 force damage. On a successful save,
the creature takes half as much damage.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force power slot of 4th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
