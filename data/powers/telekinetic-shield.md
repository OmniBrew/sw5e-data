You lift three piles of debris or small objects from the
ground and interpose them between you and your
opponents for the duration.
While at least three piles remain, you have threequarters
cover. While two piles remain, you have half
cover. While only one pile remains, you have onequarter
cover. The piles don't hinder your attacks.
When you cast the power, or as an action on a
subsequent turn, you can direct up to two piles to
attack up to two creatures you can see within 30 feet.
Make a ranged force attack roll for each pile. On a hit, a
creature takes 2d6 kinetic plus 1d10 force damage. The
pile is destroyed whether it hits or misses.
Force Potency. If you cast this power with a force
slot of 4th level or higher, the power creates one
additional pile for each level above 3rd.
