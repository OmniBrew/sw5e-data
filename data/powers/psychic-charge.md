As part of the action used to cast this power, you
must make a melee weapon attack against one
creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails.
On a hit, the target su􀃠ers the attack's normal e􀃠ects,
and its mouth is covered by a violet veil until the start
of your next turn. If the target willingly speaks before
then, it immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage, and
the power ends.
This power's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target, and the
damage the target takes for speaking increases to 2d8.
Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and
17th level.
