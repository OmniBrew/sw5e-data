This power enables you to use your health to fuel
your force powers. For the duration, when you cast a
force power, you can choose to pay up to half the cost
of the force power using your hit points instead of your
force points. When you do so, your maximum hit
points are reduced by the same amount until you
complete a long rest.
You may end this effect at any time. If you cast a
force power that would reduce your hit points to 0, the
power automatically fails and this effect ends.
