You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing
creatures of your choice that you can see within range
fall unconscious for the power's duration. The power
ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone
uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target
remains unconscious for the full duration, that target
gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected
by this power again until it finishes a long rest. This
power has no effect on droids or constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one
additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.
