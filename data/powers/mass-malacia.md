Each creature in a 30-foot cube within range must
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature becomes charmed for the duration. While
charmed by this power, the creature is incapacitated
and has a speed of 0.
The power ends for an a􀃠ected creature if it takes
any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake
the creature out of its stupor. This power has no e􀃠ect
on droids or constructs.
