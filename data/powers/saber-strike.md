As part of the action used to cast the power, you can move up to your speed and make one melee weapon attack. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weaponâ€™s type. In addition, if you hit with the attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Force Potency. When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus weapon damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
