You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can
see within range and create an illusory manifestation
of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
become frightened for the duration. At the end of each
of the target's turns before the power ends, the target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10
psychic damage. On a successful save, the power ends.
This power has no effect on droids or constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force power slot of 5th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
