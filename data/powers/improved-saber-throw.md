As a part of the action used to cast this power, you
must make a ranged force attack with a lightweapon or
vibroweapon against one target within the power's
range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target
takes 2d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's
damage and must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the target gains 1 slowed level until
the end of its next turn and the weapon then
immediately returns to your hand. The next attack
made against the target that hits it before the end of
the target's next turn deals an additional 1d10 force
damage. On a successful save, the target takes half as
much additional force damage on the next attack that
hits it, and suffers no additional effect. The weapon
then immediately returns to your hand.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
