You touch a creature and stimulate its natural
healing ability. The target regains 4d8+15 hit points.
For the duration of the power, the target regains 1 hit
point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each
minute).
If the creature has a severed part you hold it to the
stump, the power instantaneously causes the limb to
knit to the stump.
This power has no effect on droids or constructs.
