You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures
and objects with the Force. When you cast this power,
and as your action each round for the duration, you
can exert your will on one creature or object that you
can see within range, causing the appropriate e􀃠ect
below. You can a􀃠ect the same target round after
round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch
targets, the prior target is no longer a􀃠ected by the
power.
Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller
creature. The target must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, you move the creature up to
30 feet in any direction, including upward but not
beyond the range of this power. Until the end of your
next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic
grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to
attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the
creature by repeating the contest.
Object. You move an object that isn't being worn or
carried and weighs up to 2,500 lbs up to 30 feet in any
direction, but not beyond the range of this power.
You can exert 􀃕ne control on objects with your
telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool,
opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an
item from an open container, or pouring the contents
from a vial.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 6th level or higher, the maximum object
weight increases by 2,500 lbs for every slot level above
5th.
