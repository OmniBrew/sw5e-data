Choose up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot
cube within range. Each target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or be a􀃠ected by this power
for the duration.
An a􀃠ected target gains 1 slowed level, it takes a -2
penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't
use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or
a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's
abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or
ranged attack during its turn.
If the creature attempts to cast a power with a
casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher,
the power doesn't take e􀃠ect until the creature's next
turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn
to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.
A creature a􀃠ected by this power makes another
Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn. On a
successful save, the e􀃠ect ends for it.
