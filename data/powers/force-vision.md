You receive a vision of the future through the Force,
giving you or one willing creature you can see within
range a chance to change fate. When the chosen
creature makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a
saving throw before the power ends, it can dismiss this
power on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose
which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack
roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss
this power on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of
the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the
attacker rolled.
If the original d20 roll has advantage or
disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20
after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to
the original roll.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
