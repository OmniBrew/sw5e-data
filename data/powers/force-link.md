You create a telepathic link between yourself and a
willing creature with which you are familiar. Until the
power ends, you and the target can instantaneously
share words, images, sounds, and other sensory
messages with one another through the link, and the
target recognizes you as the creature it is
communicating with. The power enables a creature
with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand
the meaning of your words and take in the scope of
any sensory messages you send to it. This power has
no effect on droids or constructs.
