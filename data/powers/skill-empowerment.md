Your power with the Force deepens a creature's
understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing
creature and give it expertise in one skill of your
choice; until the power ends, the creature doubles its
pro􀃕ciency bonus for ability checks it makes that use
the chosen skill.
You must choose a skill in which the target is
pro􀃕cient and that isn't already bene􀃕ting from an
e􀃠ect, such as Expertise, that doubles its pro􀃕ciency
bonus.
