You conjure a blade of spirit energy and attempt to
strike one creature. Make a melee force attack against
the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d10
necrotic damage.
This power can make multiple attacks at higher
levels: two attacks at 5th level, three attacks at 11th
level, and four attacks at 17th level. Each attack can
target the same creature or diô€ƒ erent ones. Make a
separate attack roll for each target.
