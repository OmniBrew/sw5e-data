You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see
within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or
creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has
advantage on the saving throw.
While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic
link with it as long as you are within 1 mile of it. You
can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the
creature while you are conscious (no action required),
which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple
and general course of action, such as "Attack that
creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If
the creature completes the order and doesn't receive
further direction from you, it defends and preserves
itself to the best of its ability.
You can use your action to take total and precise
control of the target. Until the end of your next turn,
the creature takes only the actions you choose, and
doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.
During this time, you can also cause the creature to
use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own
reaction as well.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new
Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving
throw succeeds, the power ends. This power has no
effect on droids or constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power with a 9thlevel force slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8
hours.
