You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature
you can see within range. The target must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the
duration. A target with 25 hit points or fewer makes
the saving throw with disadvantage. A frightened
creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its
turns, ending this effect on a success. This power has
no effect on constructs or droids.
