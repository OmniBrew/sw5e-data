Describe or name an object. You sense the direction
to the object's location, as long as its within 1000 feet
of you. If the object is in motion, you know the
direction of its movement. The power can locate a
specific object known to you, as long as you have seen
it while within 30 feet of it. Alternatively, the power can
locate the nearest object of a particular kind. This
power can't locate an object if any thickness of lead
blocks a direct path between you and the object.
