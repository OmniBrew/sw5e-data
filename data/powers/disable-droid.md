Choose a point that you can see within range. Each
droid or construct must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the
beginning of each of its turns, an affected creature
takes energy damage equal to your forcecasting ability
modifier and then repeats this saving throw. On a
success, the power ends on the target.
