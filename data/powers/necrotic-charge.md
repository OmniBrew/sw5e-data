As part of the action used to cast this power, you
must make a melee weapon attack against one
creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails.
On a hit, the target su􀃠ers the attack's normal e􀃠ects,
and you can choose to deal up to 1d8 of necrotic
damage, which you su􀃠er as well. This damage can't be
reduced or negated in any way.
This power's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and you can
increase the secondary damage to 2d8. Both damage
rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.
