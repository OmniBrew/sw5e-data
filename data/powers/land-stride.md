You align yourself with nature, making traversing natural environments far easier. For the duration, your movement and that of creatures of your choice within 40 feet of you canâ€™t be slowed by natural terrain, such as mud, rocky ground, vines, or tall grass. Climbing still costs double normal movement. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no traces of its passage.
