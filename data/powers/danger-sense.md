You put your faith in the Force, feeling out the future
and seeing whether your actions will lead to fortune or
ruin. The GM chooses from the following possible
omens:
Peace, for results which are not dangerous
Danger, for results which are dangerous but perhaps
still worth the danger
Ruin, for results which are certain to end in death or
tragedy
The power doesn't take into account any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such as
the use of additional powers or the loss or gain of a
companion.
If you use this power two or more times before
completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative
25 percent chance for each casting after the first that
you get a neutral result regardless of the actual
outcome.
