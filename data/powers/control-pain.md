You use the Force to push your body beyond its
normal limits. You can't die from damage or from failed
death saving throws while this power is in effect, but
the effort taxes you. If you have 0 hit points while you
are under the effect of this power, you do not fall
unconscious, and continue acting and fighting
normally. While you remain at 0 hit points, you must
make a death saving throw at the start of each of your
turns. Each time you fail a death saving throw, you
suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls, ability
checks, and saving throws (including death saving
throws). This penalty lasts until you regain hit points.
Successful death saving throws have no effect, but a
natural 20 restores 1 hit point as usual.
If you have 0 hit points when this power ends, you
die instantly.
