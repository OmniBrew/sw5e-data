A target of your choice within range must make a
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, when the
target makes their next attack roll or saving throw they
must roll a d4 and subtract the number from it. The
power then ends.
This power's die increases at higher levels: to a d6 at
5th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 17th level.
