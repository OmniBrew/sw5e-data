For the duration, you gain the ability to
"communicate" telepathically with inanimate objects
you touch. You can ask up to 􀃕ve questions and receive
answers from objects, usually in the form of a auditory
or visual hallucination. For example, touching the
rusted, broken remains of a lightsaber and asking how
it got there may result in a brief vision of a disgruntled
Jedi Knight casting it to the ground on that spot. An
object "questioned" in this way can only provide
information relating to its past. The DM has the 􀃕nal
say on what objects can be questioned, and to what
extent.
