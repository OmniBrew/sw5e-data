You alter your form with tech. When you cast the power, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the power. While the power lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species (an organic species cannot appear as a droid, or vice versa), though none of your statistics change. You can also alter your vocal cords, enabling you to speak a language you know, but otherwise would be incapable of speaking. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this power to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the power, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your damage die for your unarmed strikes increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8). Your unarmed strikes are considered enhanced and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with them.
