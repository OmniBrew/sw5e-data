You unleash the power of your mind to blast the
intellect of up to ten creatures of your choice that you
can see within range. Creatures that have an
Intelligence score of 2 or lower are una􀃠ected.
Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw.
On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 psychic damage
and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes
half as much damage and isn't stunned.
A stunned target can make a Wisdom saving throw at
the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the
stunning e􀃠ect ends.
