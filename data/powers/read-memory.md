You read the memory of an incapacitated droid or construct within range. The target must have its memory core (and/or other appropriate components) intact.

Until the power ends, you can ask up to five questions. Depending on what it would know or has witnessed, the target provides visual, audio, or text-based data in response. The target canï¿½t provide new information, and can't speculate about future events.
