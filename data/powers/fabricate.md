You convert raw materials into products of the same material.
For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from bantha hide.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the power is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or enhanced items can't be created by this power. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of tool used to craft such objects.
