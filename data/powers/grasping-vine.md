You make a vine sprout from the ground in an
unoccupied space you can see. When you cast this
power, you can make the vine whip a creature up to 30
feet from it, if you can see the target. The creature
must pass a Dexterity save or be pulled 20 feet directly
toward the vine.
Until the power ends, you can use your bonus action
to have the vine lash out again.
