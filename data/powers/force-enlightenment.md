Choose one of the following effects; the target gains
that effect until the power ends.
Strength. The target has advantage on Strength
checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.
Dexterity. The target has advantage on Dexterity
checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet
or less if it isn't incapacitated.

checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which
are lost when the power ends.
Cunning. The target has advantage on Intelligence
checks.
Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.
Splendor. The target has advantage on Charisma

This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

force slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
