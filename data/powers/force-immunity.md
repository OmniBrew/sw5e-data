An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into
existence around you and remains for the duration.
The barrier moves with you. Any force power of 3rd
level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect
you, even if the power is cast using a higher level force
slot. Such a power can target you, but the power has
no effect on you. Similarly, the area within the barrier
is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 5th level or higher, the barrier blocks
powers of one level higher for each slot level above
4th.
