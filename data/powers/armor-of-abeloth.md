A protective force surrounds you, manifesting as
shimmering light that covers you and your gear. You
gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a
creature hits you with a melee attack while you have
these hit points, the creature takes 5 psychic damage.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit
points and the psychic damage increase by 5 for each
slot.
