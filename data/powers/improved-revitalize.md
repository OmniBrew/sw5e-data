You return a dead creature you touch to life,
provided that it has been dead no longer than 1 hour.
If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to
rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with all its
hit points. This power has no effect on droids or
constructs.
This power also neutralizes any poisons and cures
diseases that affected the creature at the time it died.
This power closes all mortal wounds and restores
any missing body parts.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest,
the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
