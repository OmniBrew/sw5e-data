You unleash a burst of psychic energy at a target
within range. If the target can hear you (though it need
not understand you), it must succeed on an
Intelligence saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage
and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes
before the end of its next turn.
This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you
reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level
(4d4).
