You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell
that only it perceives. One creature you can see within
range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The
target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being
charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10
psychic damage, and the power ends. On a failed save,
the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make
the area immediately around the target's space appear
dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the
target to perceive itself as being surrounded by 􀃕re, a
storm of blaster-􀃕re, or deadly toxic gas, for example.
Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see
or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the
power's duration. If the target is moved out of the
illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches
any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10
psychic damage, and the power ends. This power has
no e􀃠ect on droids or constructs.
