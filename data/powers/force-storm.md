A crackling storm of lightning with a diameter of 60
feet and a height of 120 feet appears in a location you
choose within range. Whenever a creature enters the
storm or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 30d6 lightning
damage or half as much as a successful one.
The power damages objects in the area and ignites
flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
