You are able to slow your metabolism in such a way
that you can stop breathing and resist the effect of
toxins in your body. If you are poisoned, you neutralize
the poison. If more than one poison afflicts you, you
neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you
neutralize one at random.
For the duration, you have advantage on saving
throws against being poisoned, resistance to poison
damage, and you no longer need to breathe.
