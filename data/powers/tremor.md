You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each
creature other than you in a 5-foot-radius sphere
centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 kinetic
damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save,
the creature takes half as much damage and isn't
knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth
or stone, it becomes diô€ƒžcult terrain until cleared, with
each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1
minute to clear by hand.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
