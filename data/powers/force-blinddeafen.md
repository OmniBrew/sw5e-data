You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature
that you can see within range to make a Constitution
saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or
deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of
each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution
saving throw. On a success, the power ends.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
