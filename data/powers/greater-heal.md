Choose a creature that you can see within range. A
surge of positive energy washes through the creature,
causing it to regain 70 hit points. This power also ends
blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the
target. This power has no effect on droids or
constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 7th level or higher, the healing increases
by 10 for each slot level above 6th.
