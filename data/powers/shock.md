You hurl a bolt of lightning at a target within range,
making a ranged force attack. On a hit, the target takes
1d10 lightning damage. The lightning ignites
ô€ƒ–ammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or
carried.
This power's damage increases by 1d10 when you
reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level
(4d10).
