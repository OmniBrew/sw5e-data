You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing
creatures of your choice within range, psychically
linking each creature to all the others for the duration.
Droids, constructs, and creatures with Intelligence
scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this power.
Until the power ends, the targets can communicate
telepathically through the bond whether or not they
have a common language. The communication is
possible over any distance, though it can't extend
beyond a single planet.
