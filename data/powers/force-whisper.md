You use the Force to carry a message in your voice to
another creature within range. The target (and only the
target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper
that only you can hear.
You can cast this power through solid objects if you
are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the
barrier. An enhanced silence effect, 1 foot of stone, 1
inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of
wood blocks the power. The power doesn't have to
follow a straight line and can travel freely around
corners or through openings.
