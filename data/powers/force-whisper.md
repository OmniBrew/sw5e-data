You use the Force to carry a message in your voice to another creature within range. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this power through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. An enhanced silence effect, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the power. The power doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
