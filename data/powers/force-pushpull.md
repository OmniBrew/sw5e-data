You gain the minor ability to move or manipulate
creatures and objects with the Force. You can exert
fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such
as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a
container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open
container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
Alternatively, you can push or pull a creature or object
you can see.
You use the Force to move a Medium or smaller
creature or object not being worn or carried within
range. The target must make a Strength saving throw.
An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature or object moves a number of
feet in a direction of your choice based on its size. A
Tiny creature or object can be moved up to 20 feet, a
Small creature or object can be moved up to 10 feet,
and a Medium creature or object can be moved up to 5
feet. If at the end of this movement the creature or
object strikes another creature or object, it must make
a Dexterity saving throw. An object automatically fails
this saving throw. On a failed save, they both take 1d4
kinetic damage.
This power improves when you reach higher levels.
At 5th level, you can move a Tiny creature or object up
to 30 feet, a Small creature or object up to 20 feet, a
Medium creature or object up to 10 feet, and the
power's damage increases to 2d4 kinetic damage. At
11th level, you can move a Small creature or object up
to 30 feet, a Medium creature up to 20 feet, and the
power's damage increases to 3d4 kinetic damage. At
17th level, you can move a Medium creature to up 30
feet, and the power's damage increases to 4d4 kinetic
damage.
