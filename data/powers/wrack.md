You wrack the body of a creature that you can see
with a virulent, disease-like condition. The target must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it
takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage
on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the
target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving
throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by
an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any
eô€ƒ ect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit
point maximum to return to normal immediately.
Force Potency. If you cast this power using a force
slot of 7th level or higher, the power deals an extra 2d6
damage for each slot level above 6th.
