You exude an aura out to 30 feet that boosts the
morale and overall battle prowess you and your allies
while simultaneously reducing the opposition's
combat-e􀃠ectiveness by eroding their will to 􀃕ght.
Whenever you or a friendly creature within your
meditation makes an attack roll or a saving throw, they
can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the attack
roll or saving throw.
Whenever a hostile creature enters your meditation
or starts its turn there, it must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failed save, it must roll a d8 and subtract
the number rolled from each attack roll or saving
throw it makes before the end of your next turn. On a
successful save, it is immune to this power for 1 day.
