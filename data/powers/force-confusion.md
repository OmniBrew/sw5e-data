One humanoid of your choice that you can see
within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or become charmed by you for the duration. The
charmed target must use its action before moving on
each of its turns to make a melee attack against a
creature other than itself that you mentally choose.
The target can act normally on its turn if you choose
no creature or if none are within its reach.
On your subsequent turns, you must use your action
to maintain control over the target, or the power ends.
Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at
the end of each of its turns. On a success, the power
ends.
