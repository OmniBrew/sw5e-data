Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of
creatures this power can affect. Creatures within 20
feet of a point you choose are affected in order of their
current hit points.
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current
hit points, each creature affected by this power falls
unconscious. If the power ends, the sleeper takes
damage, or someone uses an action wake the sleeper,
they will be awoken.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next lowest
hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or
less than the remaining total for that creature to be
affected.
This power has no effect on droids or constructs.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, you can roll an
additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.
