You unleash a blast of psychic energy at a target
within range. If the target can hear you (though it need
not understand you), it must succeed on an
Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6
psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction,
if available, to move as far as its speed allows away
from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously
dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a
successful save, the target takes half as much damage
and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature
automatically succeeds on the save.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
