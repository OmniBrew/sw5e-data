A flood of kolto energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this power are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.
