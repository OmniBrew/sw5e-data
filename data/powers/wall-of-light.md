You conjure an immense manifestation of
destructive light side Force energy. The wall appears
within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a
straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5
feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20
feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides threequarters
cover and its space is di􀃞cult terrain.
When a creature enters the wall's area for the 􀃕rst
time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 6d10 force damage, or half as much on a
success.
