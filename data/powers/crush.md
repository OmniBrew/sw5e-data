You make a crushing gesture at a creature within
range. The target must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save target takes 10d8 force damage
and is paralyzed until the end of your next turn. On a
successful save, the target takes half as much damage
and is not paralyzed.
You can use a bonus action while the target is
paralyzed to move the target up to 10 feet in any
direction.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
