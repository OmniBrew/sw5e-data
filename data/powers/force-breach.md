Choose a spot within range. All force powers of 5th
level or lower in the area end. For each force power of
6th level or higher in the area, make an ability check
using your forcecasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the
power's level. On a successful check, the force power
ends.
Force Potency. When you cast this power using a
force slot of 6th level or higher, you automatically end
the effects of a force power on the target if the power's
level is equal to or less than the level of the force slot
you used.
