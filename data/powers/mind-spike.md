Choose one creature you can see. The target must
make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 3d8
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed
save, you always know the target's location, but only
while the two of you are on the same planet. The target
can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it
gains no bene􀃕ts from this condition against you. This
power has no e􀃠ect on droids or constructs.
