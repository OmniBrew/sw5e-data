Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of
creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds,
manifesting their worst nightmares as an implacable
threat visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-footradius
sphere is frightened for the duration of the
power. At the end of each of the frightened creature's
turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
take 5d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the
power ends for that creature. This power has no eô€ƒ ect
on droids or constructs.
