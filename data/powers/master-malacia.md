Choose one creature that you can see within range.
The creature reels with extreme dizziness and nausea
for the duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are
immune to this power.
The a􀃠ected creature must use all of its movement
to writhe in discomfort without leaving its space and
has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and
attack rolls. While the target is a􀃠ected by this power,
other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against
it. As an action, an a􀃠ected creature makes a Wisdom
saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful
save, the power ends. This power has no e􀃠ect on
droids or constructs.
