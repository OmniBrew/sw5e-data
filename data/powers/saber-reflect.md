In response to being attacked, you raise your
weapon to attempt to de􀃖ect. When you you use this
power, the damage you take from the attack is reduced
by 1d6. If you reduce the damage to 0, you're wielding
a lightweapon or vibroweapon, and the damage is
energy or ion, you can re􀃖ect the attack at a target
within range as part of the same reaction. Make a
ranged force attack at a target you can see. The attack
has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60
feet. On a hit, the target takes the triggering attack's
normal damage.
The power's damage reduction increases by 1d6
when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and
17th level (4d6).
