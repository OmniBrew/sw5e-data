You touch a willing creature. Its movement is
unaffected by difficult terrain, and powers and
enhanced effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to
be paralyzed or restrained.
The target can spend 5 feet of movement to
automatically escape from unenhanced restraints.
Additionally, being underwater imposes no penalties
on its movement or attacks.
