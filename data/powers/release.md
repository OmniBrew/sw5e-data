Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of binders, a lock, or another object that contains a mundane or enhanced means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with *lock*, that power is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.
