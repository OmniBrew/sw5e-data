name: Power Channeling
note: "Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You've learned to cast powers of the chosen type with greater deliberation. Choose a number of powers you know of 1st level or higher equal to half your proficiency bonus. When you cast one of the chosen powers, you can choose to spend an additional minute casting the power for each level of the power. If you do so, the cost of the power is reduced by half the number of points. Casting a power in this way requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. "

Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You've learned to cast powers of the chosen type with greater deliberation. Choose a number of powers you know of 1st level or higher equal to half your proficiency bonus. When you cast one of the chosen powers, you can choose to spend an additional minute casting the power for each level of the power. If you do so, the cost of the power is reduced by half the number of points. Casting a power in this way requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. 

Whenever you gain a level in a class with casting of the chosen type, you can replace one of the chosen powers with another power of 1st level or higher you know.
