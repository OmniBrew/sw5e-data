Your presence on the battlefield is a source of inspiration. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- As a bonus action, you let out a rallying war cry, ending the frightened or charmed condition on yourself and a number of allies that can hear you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Once you've used this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
