You are specially modified droid used to house a shard. Shards are sentient crystals native to the planet Orax, roughly a foot in length, that communicate with each other through pulses of light. While inhabiting a specialized droid host, shards are able to overcome the droid's inability to wield the Force, granting the following benefits:

- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You lose the Force-Insensitive special trait.
- You can cast the *sense force* force power once per day. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for this power.
