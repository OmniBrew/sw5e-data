You've trained relentless to lead your allies on the field of battle, gaining the following benefits:
- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- As an action, you can gain tactical insight. For one minute, once per turn you can utter a special command or warning whenever an ally you can see within 30 feet makes an attack roll or saving throw. This creature can add a d4 to the roll provided it can hear and understand you. A creature can only benefit from one such die at a time. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
