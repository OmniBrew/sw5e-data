You've spent a lifetime fighting, with the scars to prove it. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you roll a 19 or a 20 on the d20 for a death saving throw, you regain 1 hit point. 
- When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you've used this ability, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
