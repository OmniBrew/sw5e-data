Your strength and virility rarely go unnoticed, often to the point of distraction. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can use your Strength modifier instead of your Constitution modifier when making Constitution checks.
- When you would make a Constitution saving throw, you can instead make a Strength saving throw. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.
