You master the physician's arts, gaining the following benefits: 
- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. 
- During a short rest, you can clean and bind the wounds of up to six willing beasts and humanoids. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check for each creature. On a success, if a creature spends a Hit Die during this rest, that creature can forgo the roll and instead regain the maximum number of hit points the die can restore. A creature can do so only once per rest, regardless of how many Hit Dice it spends.
