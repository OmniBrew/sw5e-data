Your study of history rewards you with the following benefits: 
- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency in the Lore skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. 
- When you take the Help action to aid another creature's ability check, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check. On a success, that creature's check gains a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus, as you share pertinent advice and historical examples. To receive this bonus, the creature must be able to understand what you're saying.
