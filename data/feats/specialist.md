---
You have focused training with a specific tool. Select one type of specialist's kit. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency with the chosen kit. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it. 
- You can attempt ability checks with the chosen kit without the kit present, but you have disadvantage on the check when you do so.
- Whenever you make an ability check with the chosen kit and you don't have disadvantage on the check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10, as long as you spend at least 1 minute on the check.

You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different specialist's kit.
