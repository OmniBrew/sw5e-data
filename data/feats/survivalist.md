You master wilderness lore, gaining the following benefits: 
- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. 
- You learn the *alarm* tech power. You can cast it once, using supplies scavenged around you, without the use of a wristpad and without spending tech points, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
