You excel at scaling cliffsides, hills, trees, and general climbing. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.
- You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid falling off or down while climbing. 
- You can spend 5 minutes instructing, pointing out handholds, and guiding other creatures before making a climb. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you. Each creature can add a 1d6 to any ability check or saving throw they make for that climb.
