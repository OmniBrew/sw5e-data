You have a strong aptitude for competing. Select one gaming set. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in the chosen gaming set. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.
- As long as you spend at least 1 minute using your gaming set, you can't have disadvantage on Intelligence checks you make to use the gaming set, Charisma (Deception) checks you make to bluff with the gaming set, or Wisdom (Insight) checks you make to read an opponent with whom you are competing with the gaming set.

You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different gaming set.
