Rooms never go unalerted to your presence, and the strength of your personality make others lose focus on their own social game. Powers and other effects infrequently override your force of will. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier when making Insight checks.
- When you would make a Wisdom saving throw, you can instead make a Charisma saving throw. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.
