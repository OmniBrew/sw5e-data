You've learned to utilize your gift with the Force in a specific, unique way. You gain the following benefits
- Increase your Wisdom or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- Choose a skill or tool in which you are proficient. When you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to the check if it doesn't already include that modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different skill or tool.
