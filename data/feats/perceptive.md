You hone your senses until they become razor sharp. You gain the following benefits: 
- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. 
- Being in a lightly obscured area doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks if you can both see and hear.
