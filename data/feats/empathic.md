You possess keen insight into how other people think and feel. You gain the following benefits: 
- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency in the Insight skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. 
- You can use your action to try to get uncanny insight about one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of your next turn.
