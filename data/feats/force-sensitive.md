name: Force-Sensitive
note: "You know two at-will force powers. When you reach 3rd level, you learn one 1st-level force power, which you can cast once per long rest. When you reach 5th level, you learn one 2nd-level force power, which you can once per long rest. Your forcecasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment). Additionally, you lose the Force-Insensitive special trait if you have it."
