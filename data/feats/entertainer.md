You have a natural gift for performing. Select one musical instrument. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in the chosen musical instrument. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.
- While playing your chosen musical instrument, you can always readily read the emotions of those paying attention to you. During this time, and for up to one minute after completing, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to read the emotions of those you performed for.

You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different musical instrument.
