You are an able medic, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you use a traumakit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point.
- As an action, you can spend one use of a traumakit to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature's maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can't regain hit points again in this way until it finishes a short or long rest.
