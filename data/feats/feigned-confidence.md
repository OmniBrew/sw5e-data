You've spent years pretending you know what you're doing, gaining the following benefits:
- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you would make an ability check with a skill or tool that doesn't add your proficiency bonus, you can first make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you can add your proficiency bonus to the initial ability check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
