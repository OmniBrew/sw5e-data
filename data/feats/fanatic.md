Every blow that hits your enemies make you feel closer to victory, making you shake in excitement. You gain the following benefits:
- When you score a critical hit with an attack roll or reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
- Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, you go into a fervor gaining temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your Constitution modifier.
