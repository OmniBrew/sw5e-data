You become more nimble, gaining the following benefits: 
- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. 
- As a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.
