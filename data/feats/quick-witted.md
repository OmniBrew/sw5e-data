Great ideas come to you naturally, often when your life depends on it. You always have a plan, or at least parts of it. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when making Initiative checks.
- When you would make a Dexterity saving throw, you can instead make an Intelligence saving throw. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.
