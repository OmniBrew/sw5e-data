---
A gaming set has all the pieces needed to play a specific game or type of game, such as pazaak or sabacc.
__LORE__
Your mastery of a game includes knowledge of its history, as well as of important events it was connected to or prominent historical figures involved with it.
__INSIGHT__
Playing games with someone is a good way to gain understanding of their personality, granting you a better ability to discern their lies from their truths and read their mood.
__SLEIGHT OF HAND__
Sleight of Hand is a useful skill for cheating at a game, as it allows you to swap pieces, palm cards, or alter a die roll. Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt.
__Master Strategist__
During a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 Gaming Set check to devise a new strategy or game plan. On a success, you gain advantage on your next skill check related to the game. The game must be from your Gaming Set or sufficiently related to it.
