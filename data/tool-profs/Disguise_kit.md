In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.
__INTIMIDATION__
The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.
__PERSUASION__
Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.
__CREATE DISGUISE__
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 disguise kit check to craft a disguise that mimics the appearance of a creature you spent at least 1 hour observing. To use this benefit, you must have a disguise kit with you. On a success, you can don or doff this disguise as an action. Additionally, once before your next short or long rest, you can gain a bonus to one check to pass yourself off as that creature. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this dieâ€™s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
