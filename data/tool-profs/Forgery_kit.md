A forgery kit includes all of the necessary components to craft and identify forged documents, including copying a person’s seal or signature.
__DECEPTION__
A well-crafted forgery, such as papers proclaiming you to be a noble or a writ that grants you safe passage, can lend credence to a lie.
__LORE__
A forgery kit combined with your knowledge of history improves your ability to create fake historical documents or to tell if an old document is authentic.
__INVESTIGATION__
When you examine objects, proficiency with a forgery kit is useful for determining how an object was made and whether it is genuine.

__QUICK FAKE__
As a part of a short rest, you can produce a forged document no more than one page in length. As a part of a long rest, you can produce a document that is up to four pages long. Your Intelligence check using a forgery kit determines the DC for someone else’s Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot the fake.
