A trapper’s kit includes all the necessary components to create, set, and disarm traps. This kit is vital for hunters, scouts, and those who need to protect an area with hidden snares and pitfalls.

__Survival__. You can determine the age and origin of objects, even if you have only a few pieces remaining from the original.

__Stealth:__. When you inspect a damaged object, you gain knowledge of how it was damaged and how long ago.

__Investigation__. For 1 omni-gel, you can repair a single break or tear in an object, such as a punctured tire, a cracked helmet, or a ripped pack.
As long as the break or tear is no larger than 30 cm (~ 1 foot) in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.


__Trap Mastery__. During a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 Trapper’s Kit check to set a sophisticated trap. On a success, the trap has a +1 bonus to its DC to be detected or disarmed for the next 24 hours.
