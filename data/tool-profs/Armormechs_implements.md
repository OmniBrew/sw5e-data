Armormech’s implements include all of the necessary components to allow you to work raw materials to craft or repair damage to armor and shields.
__LORE__
Your expertise lends you additional insight when examining armor and shields.
__INVESTIGATION__
You can spot clues and make deductions that others might overlook when an investigation involves armor and shields.
__STEALTH__
Your greater understanding of armor you - or your allies - wear allows for more cautious movement.
__BOOST ARMOR__
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 armormech’s implements check to temporarily improve a suit of armor or a shield. To use this benefit, you must have armormech’s implements with you, and the object must be within reach. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a character wearing this armor or wielding this shield can gain a bonus to AC against one attack. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this die’s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
