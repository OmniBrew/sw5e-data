__LORE__
This tool proficiency aids you in identifying the use and the origin of buildings and structures.
__INVESTIGATION/PERCEPTION__
You gain additional insight when inspecting areas within structures, because you know tricks of construction that can conceal areas from discovery.
__TEMPORARY SHELTER__
As part of a long rest, you can construct a lean-to or a similar shelter to keep your group dry and in the shade for the duration of the rest. Because it was fashioned quickly from whatever wood was available, the shelter collapses 1d3 days after being assembled.
