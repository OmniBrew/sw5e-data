__MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS__. 
A musical instrument includes all of the necessary components to play it, as well as a few songs commonly performed with that instrument.

__LORE__. 
Your expertise aids you in recalling lore related to your instrument.

__PERFORMANCE__. 
Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.
SKILL 3
Skill and tool description interaction.

__Distracting Performance__. 
While performing with your instrument, you can try to distract one sentient creature you can see who can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check with your instrument contested by the humanoid's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, you grab the creature's attention enough that it makes Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks with disadvantage until you stop performing.

__Inspiring Melody__. 
During a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 Musical Instrument check to play an inspiring melody. On a success, allies who hear the performance gain a +1 bonus to their next skill check or saving throw within the next 24 hours.
