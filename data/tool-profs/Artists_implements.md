Artist’s implements include all of the necessary components to create and store art.
__LORE__
Your expertise aids you in uncovering lore of any sort that is attached to a work of art, such as the mystical properties of a painting or the origins of a strange mural found in a dungeon.
__INVESTIGATION AND PERCEPTION__
When you inspect a painting or a similar work of visual art, your knowledge of the practices behind creating it can grant you additional insight.
__COMMEMORATE EVENT__
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 artist’s implements check to create a depiction of an event, person, or other noteworthy object. To use this benefit, you must have artist’s implements with you. On a success, you create a rendition that perfectly captures the event in question, provided the event happened no more than one day ago. If you have expertise in the tool, you can instead capture an event that happened no more than one week ago.
