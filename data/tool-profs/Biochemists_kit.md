A biochemist’s kit includes all of the necessary components to create and house standard adrenals, medpacs, and stimpacs.
__INVESTIGATION__
Proficiency with biochemist’s kit allows you to unlock more information on Investigation checks involving adrenals, medpacs, and stimpacs.
__PERCEPTION__
When you inspect an area for clues, proficiency with biochemist’s kit grants additional insight into any chemicals or other substances that might have been used in the area.
__SKILL 3__
Skill and tool description interaction.
__MEDPAC IMPROVEMENT__
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 biochemist’s kit check to temporarily improve the potency of one medpac. To use this benefit, you must have a biochemist’s kit with you, and the medpac must be within reach. If the medpac is consumed before the end of your next short or long rest, when a creature uses this medpac, they take the maximum instead of rolling.
