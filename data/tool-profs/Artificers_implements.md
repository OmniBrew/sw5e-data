Artificer’s implements include all of the necessary components to allow you to craft and repair focus generators, holocrons, and lightweapons.

__INSIGHT__. 
You have greater intuition when dealing with spirits trapped in holocrons.

__LORE__. 
Your expertise lends you additional insight when determining the origin and age of lightweapons.

__TECHNOLOGY__. 
Your knowledge grants you greater understanding when reverse engineering lightweapon or focus generator item modifications.

__LENS IMPROVEMENT__. 
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 artificer’s implements check to temporarily improve a lightweapon or focus generator. To use this benefit, you must have artificer’s implements with you, and the object must be within reach. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a character wielding this lightweapon can gain a bonus to one weapon attack roll, or focus generator can gain a bonus to one force attack roll. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this die’s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
