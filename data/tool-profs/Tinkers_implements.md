You are more effective at identifying traps concealed by debris.
__SLEIGHT OF HAND__

__MULTITOOL__
You can use tinker’s implements as other tools with which you are proficient. You still make the ability check with the other tool, but you do not require a physical set of the other tools. If you have expertise in the other tools, you must also have expertise in tinker’s implements to gain the benefit of that expertise when using tinker’s implements in this way.
__REPAIR TRINKETS__
With access to your tools, you can repair small items. For any object, you need access to raw materials required to repair it.

To use this benefit, you must have writer’s implements and a source on which to scribe your instruction. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher can spend 10 minutes reading your manual, after which they gain proficiency in the chosen skill or tool. This benefit lasts until you or the creature complete a short or long rest.
