__INVESTIGATION/PERCEPTION__. 
You are more effective at identifying traps concealed by debris.

__SLEIGHT OF HAND__. 
You are more effective at hiding traps that you place.

__MULTITOOL__. 
You can use tinker’s implements as other tools with which you are proficient. You still make the ability check with the other tool, but you do not require a physical set of the other tools. If you have expertise in the other tools, you must also have expertise in tinker’s implements to gain the benefit of that expertise when using tinker’s implements in this way.

__REPAIR TRINKETS__
With access to your tools, you can repair small items. For any object, you need access to raw materials required to repair it.
