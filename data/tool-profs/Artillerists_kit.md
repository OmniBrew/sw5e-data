__LORE__. 
Your proficiency allows you to more readily discern the history of any turrets you encounter.

__INVESTIGATION AND PERCEPTION__. 
Your experience lets you more readily identify aftermarket modifications in turrets.

__TURRET IMPROVEMENTS__. 
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 artillerist’s kit check to temporarily improve a turret. To use this benefit, you must have an artillerist’s kit with you, and the object must be within reach. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, this turret can gain a bonus to one attack roll or a bonus to one save DC. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this die’s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
