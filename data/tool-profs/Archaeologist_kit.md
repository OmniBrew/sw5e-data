type: artisan
name: Archaeologist kit
---
This kit contains instruments used to carefully collect crystals, gems, relics, and other heirlooms. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to classify, collect, and polish gems and relics.

__SURVIVAL__.  
When searching in the wild, you can more easily search for places that might house relics.

__INVESTIGATION__. 
You can easily spot the location of potential gemstones or other precious relics.

__PERSUASION__. 
When bartering while precious stones or relics are involved, you can more easily negotiate a fair price.

__CRYSTAL ENHANCEMENT__. 
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 archaelogist kit check to temporarily improve a lightweapon or focus generator. To use this benefit, you must have archaelogist kit with you, and the object must be within reach. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a character wielding this lightweapon can gain a bonus to one weapon damage roll, or focus generator can gain a bonus to one force damage or healing roll. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this dieâ€™s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
