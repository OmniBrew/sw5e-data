Armstech’s implements include all of the necessary components to allow you to work raw materials to craft or repair damage to blasters and vibroweapons.


__LORE__. 
Your expertise lends you additional insight when examining blasters and vibroweapons.


__INVESTIGATION__. 
You can spot clues and make deductions that others might overlook when an investigation involves blasters and vibroweapons.


__TECHNOLOGY__. 
You can more readily identify an enhanced blaster or vibroweapons properties.


__AMPLIFY WEAPON__. 
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 arsmtech’s implements check to temporarily improve a blaster or vibroweapon. To use this benefit, you must have arsmtech’s implements with you, and the object must be within reach. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a character wielding this weapon can gain a bonus to one weapon attack. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this die’s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
