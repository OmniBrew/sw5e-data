__History__. Your expertise lends you additional insight when examining weapons.

__Investigation__. You can spot clues and make deductions that others might overlook when an investigation involves weapons.

__SLEIGHT OF HAND__. 
Precisely assemble and disassemble delicate or explosive components.

__HONE WEAPON__. 
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 munitions kit check to temporarily improve a blaster or vibroweapon. To use this benefit, you must have munitions kit with you, and the object must be within reach. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a character wielding this weapon can gain a bonus to one weapon damage roll. This bonus is a die, with a maximum value equal to your proficiency bonus. If you have expertise in the tool, this dieâ€™s maximum is instead equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
