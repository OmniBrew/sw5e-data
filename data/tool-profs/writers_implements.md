Over the course of a short or long rest, you can make a DC 15 writer’s implements check to create an instruction manual for a skill or tool in which you are proficient. To use this benefit, you must have writer’s implements and a source on which to scribe your instruction. On a success, once before your next short or long rest, a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher can spend 10 minutes reading your manual, after which they gain proficiency in the chosen skill or tool. This benefit lasts until you or the creature complete a short or long rest.
