### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The Chiss are a near-human species notable for their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicates they are an offshoot of humanity, having diverged after moving underground. Their striking physical features, which include blue skin, jet black hair, and red eyes, make them instantly recognizable.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Chiss society is highly structured and ordered. It is governed by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini, and Sabosen. These are not biological families but represent different branches of their government. Every Chiss aligns with one of the four families, determined by tradition and birthplace. The family names are a cultural holdover, as any Chiss can claim affiliation with any of the ruling families. Political assassinations are an unfortunate reality within the Ruling Families, indicating internal tensions.

### NAMES
A Chiss true-name consists of three parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part indicates their occupation. Chiss usually go by their root name and rarely share their true-name with non-Chiss.
