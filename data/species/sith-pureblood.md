### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that
evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset
system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the
Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average
number of individuals with potential to use the Force in
their species, so high in fact that the entire species was
considered strongly Force-sensitive.
Sith purebloods are characterized by their expressive
facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and
predatory gaze.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society.
For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part
of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though
they are in an almost constant state of war, their
civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts
not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of
existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of
the population on their original homeworld of Korriban
as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society.

### NAMES
Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are
often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely
share surnames, since they do not value family ties.
When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory,
they often change their name to match their perceived
newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in
sith purebloods, and their culture is built around
strength, most sith are called simply "My Lord," or
some other epithet, by their underlings.
