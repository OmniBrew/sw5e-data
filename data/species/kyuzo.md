### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
A lanky, bipedal humanoid species, the Kyuzo originate on the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of Phatrong. Kyuzo are tall and slender, though their appearance belies their strength and quickness. Due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworld’s atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently wear corrective lenses and a highly pressurized filter mask over their faces to protect their sensitive respiratory systems and assist them in coping with uncomfortable climates like galactic standard habitable environments. As well as causing respiratory and vision problems, exposure to such conditions causes a Kyuzo to become ill within in a short period of time, interfering with their ability to concentrate and slowing them down.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
A species known for its strong sense of justice and honor, most Kyuzo regard oaths and contracts as unbreakable and many species seek them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel and bounty hunters. A highly political species, the Kyuzo developed societies that span considerable geographical areas, and most identify as members of a particular country or region. Most major islands and continents on Phatrong are their own political units, though they do form a loose confederacy.

### NAMES
