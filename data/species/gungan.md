### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall
beings with extremely exible cartilaginous skeletons.
Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frogkick style swimming through water as well as a
remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears
(called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as
expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and
fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with
nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes
are unusual amongst Gungans.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful
species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly
welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious
until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans
are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their
peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go
to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed
a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a
sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.
If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very dicult for
them to return. If they do manage to return legally,
they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This
can make life very dicult for them and can go on for
months or years, until their past oenses disappear
from memory. Returning back to the settlement they
were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the
death penalty, especially if they brought along
outsiders.
