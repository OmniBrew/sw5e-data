### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Although a typical gamorrean is squat, green, and
heavily built, not all shared these characteristics. Most
gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a
large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration
does vary, particularly among females, with light
skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon.
Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white
pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less
skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark
green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to
the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied
evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown.
The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin
or eye coloration although there were some
superstitions linked to certain markings.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male
warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of
the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are
solely concerned with preparing and participating in
battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan
performed all the productive work including farming,
hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since
the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is
scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land,
and they spend their time fighting over possession.

### NAMES
Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male
names are typically one syllable while females are two.
Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than
family.
