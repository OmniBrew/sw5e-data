### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The original appearance of the theelin is officially uncertain, as almost all known “theelin” are not full-blooded specimens, but hybrids. It is possible that some aspects of these individuals’ appearances are not from their theelin genes, but from other near-human ancestors. Most, however, have vividly colored hair and pale skin, often mottled with colorful spots. Unfortunately, a series of mutations arose among later generations of theelin. These mutations have led to genetic incompatibilities within their species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue their species by cross-breeding with other near-humans could not stop the theelin slide towards extinction, due to the high infant mortality rates such couplings suffer from. Theelin began inevitably dwindling in number only a few million theelin and part-theelin remain by the time the Republic fell, and pure theelin are presumed extinct by the fall of the Empire. Some of their greatest works are produced in these years, however, as an epitaph for a dying people.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Theelin performers and artists created many of the galaxy’s greatest works of art. The Theelin Divas, an all-female religious order, are recognized by many scholars of music as the greatest singers in the galaxy. Because of the rarity of the theelin, many female theelin and part-theelin are named “Diva” at birth, in hopes that they will develop the musical talent necessary to continue the traditions of the Diva order.
