### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Pantorans are a sentient species native to Pantora, a moon orbiting the planet Orto Plutonia. At first glance, they only differ from the otherwise similar humans in their blue skin and yellow eyes. The pantorans share many traits with other blue-skinned races, especially the wroonians, and, to a lesser extent, the chiss. The pantorans also seem to have a greater resilience to low temperatures than humans, since they only needed light wardrobe even under extreme cold weather conditions.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Pantoran society developed on Pantora, a world located in a region flush with slavers and spice merchants. Constant run-ins with these types led the pantorans to become fiercely independent and proud. While the pantoran society is democratic, the feudal traditions of marking their foreheads, and cheeks with yellow markings to symbolize lineage persists into the common era. These traditions spurred a cultural interest in genealogy and history, and many pantorans cherish relics from the past such as jewelry which connect them to their noble ancestors or helmets that belonged to great heroes of a bygone age. The old nation states of Pantora are unified under a democratic planetary government, the politics of which are considered an art form. Governed by the Pantoran Assembly, the elected body is led by a Speaker, who balance the power of the chief executive officer, known as the Chairman.
