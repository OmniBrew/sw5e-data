### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Ithorians have two mouths and four throats, allowing
them to speak in stereo. Female Ithorians have two
humps on the back of their head, while males have
only one. They have glossy, usually brown flesh. Their
reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than
that of average humanoids.
In addition to allowing them to speak their unique
stereophonic language, the Ithorians' four throats also
have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a
deafening and potentially concussive scream. Despite
this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without
ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained
relatively ambiguous.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Ithorians worship the "Mother Jungle," a spiritual entity
embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world,
Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists,
staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting
much time to contemplating their ecology, studying
plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all
living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own
planet, instead living in floating cities above their world
called herdships. Only three of their continents have
been explored and harvested, the other two never
having been touched by Ithorian hands. They
demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and
sustaining of their environment as dictated by their
"Law of Life."

### NAMES
Ithorian names are quite varied in length but most
names are soft and melodic. They are often difficult to
prounounce by other species, so many Ithorians adopt
nicknames.
