### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Humans are an intelligent species that originated on
Coruscant, but can be found on many other planets
across the galaxy, including Naboo, Tatooine, and
Alderaan. They come in two sexes, male and female,
and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings
with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back
end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies
are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs
attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands
which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs,
end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of
articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb
that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have
one head perched atop their torso. Many other
species, including twi'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks,
are referred to as "humanoids" because of their
structural resemblance to humans.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from
politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers,
or even a farmer. There exist many planetary groups of
humans with their own cultures, such as the
Alderaanians or the Pamarthens. Humans are the most
populous species in the Galaxy.
