### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Zabrak are near-human, but have a number of
significant physical characteristics that set them apart
from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are
a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both
males and females. These horns grow at puberty in
varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage
is drawing near.
In addition to their horns, another of the traits that
make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial
tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received
during their rite of passage. These could symbolize
many things, including but not limited to family lineage,
place of birth, or even a design that reflected their
individual personalities.
Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being
single-minded, an observation that is not terribly
incorrect. This single-minded determination comes
from the fact that they are a species with a strong
sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able
to accomplish any task that they set out to do.
However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a
sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it
is not uncommon to see competition between
colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks
believe that the various experiences of the different
colonies only serve to add to the species' overall value
throughout the galaxy.

### NAMES
Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals
living on their planet. Zabraks don't use surnames.
