### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Twi'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals
were known to exist. Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is
essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld,
Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual
trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When
traveling off their homeworld, twi'leks rarely refuse
food, which frequently leads to obesity among
starfarers. Twi'lek society also considers obesity as a
sign of influence and success.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female
twi'leks make them a popular target among slave
traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some
see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or
selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a
way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's
harsh environment. A number of twi'leks believe that
slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species
and preserve their culture, as the twi'leks lack their
own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how
it came about, many twi'leks live as slaves or
entertainers and are considered status symbols,
especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that
manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life
of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making
use of their powers of seduction.

### NAMES
Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan
name into a single name, rather than having a separate
surname.
