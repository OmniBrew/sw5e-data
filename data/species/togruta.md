### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Togruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from blue
to red to green, with white pigmentation on their faces,
greyish lips, and white stripes adorn various parts of
their bodies. The pattern of stripes varies from
individual to individual. This red and white pattern was
a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage
that helped them to blend in with Shili's natural
surroundings.
Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four
head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the
montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the
proximity and movement of physical objects around
them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect
space ultrasonically. Young togrutas' montrals and
posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence,
when their montrals curve and their final head-tail
grows to the length of their other head-tails.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness.
On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each
other and band together to take a stand against the
massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of
Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more
reason for the native togruta to work together. While
most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the
togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the togruta live in
small communities in the forest valleys.
