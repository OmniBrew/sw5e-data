  You can speak, read, and write Jawaese
(and the Jawa Trade Language). You can understand
spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords
do not allow you to speak it. Jawaese blends quickly
spoken, semi-meaningless syllables with scents to be
understood. To more easily bargain and trade with
other species, they rely on a simplified variant called
the Jawa Trade language which removes the use of
scent.

### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown
hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to
wear other colors. Other notable features included
their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high
pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese.
Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt,
rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow
eyes.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species
who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the
deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid
or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star
travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas
regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a
description that most jawas actually find pleasing.
The jawa's unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a
salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else
who might find a use for it. This is evidenced in their
endless search for wares with which to trade with
almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of
instinctive feel for machinery and electronics,
notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment
functioning just well enough to sell.

### NAMES
Jawa names are quickly spoken, complex, and often
misunderstood. Jawas who spend the majority of their
time around other species respond well to nicknames.
Male and female names do not significantly deviate.
Surnames are clan based.
Male names. Bilvu, Mnak, Penk, Plin, Vih
Female names. Bahimos, Kola, Levu, Rhovi, Uvet
Surnames. Kkejenem, M'avoe, Tjoteelt, Wiamoel
