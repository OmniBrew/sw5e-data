### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Draethos possess large teeth, which grow outside of their mouths. Coupled with their lack of lips, this leads to the appearance of an overbite. Their scaly skin ranged in color from blue to purple to black. Their hands retain an interstitial web between the fingers. Their fingers end in narrow tips which resemble claws. They possess low-light vision, springing from their cave-dwelling ancestors.

Draethos possess a limited telepathy, granting the ability to communicate with any sentient being. The ability is limited to communication; a Draethos can not invade the thoughts of others.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Partly due to their long lives, Draethos society was slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. The Draethos’ culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens. Consequently, despite their reputation as fierce combatants, most Draethos encountered offworld are peaceful and intellectual.

### NAMES
Due to their lack of lips, Draethos names typically lack hard consonants. Surnames are familial.
