### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Diathim are a mysterious species of winged sentients famed for their radiance and beauty. They often make appearances as angelic figures in the folklore of numerous species. Their bodies naturally give off an intense light, obfuscating their physical forms to the naked eye. They have three pairs of thin, translucent wings that appear fragile, but are more than capable of flight. Diathim have been known to survive in the vacuum of space without the need for protective gear, and have a mild hypnotic effect on others in their presence, adding to the legends surrounding them.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
The diathim give off an aura of kindness, and are consistently described as benevolent by spacers, causing tales of their rare appearances to morph over time into the grandiose mythology of the “Angels.” The diathim are reputed for their beauty, and the way in which they appear varies depending on the beholder. Diathim are fascinated by spacecraft, which often prompted them to mob any ships that found themselves in the vicinity of their homeworld Iego and its largest moon Millius Prime.

Diathim have only commonly been seen gathering in flocks to welcome arriving ships, and knowledge of their habitat remains a mystery to outsiders. Although they have no apparent language of their own, they have readily adopted Galactic Basic, the common language of the galaxy.
