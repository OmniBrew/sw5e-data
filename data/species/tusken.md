### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
While Tuskens, also known as Tusken Raiders or Sand
People, are easily recognizable by their full-body
clothing, goggles, and mouth filters, little of their true
physical appearance can be discerned. From birth,
Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare
occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of
another person. This, combined with their hostility to
outsiders and Tatooine's remote and arid nature,
makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in
small clans scattered throughout Tatooine's deserts.
Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment,
Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but
it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other
species into the clan. They believe that all water is
sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous
among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and
pillaging settlements and farms.
Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as
hunters and warriors, while females and children
maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond
with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as
sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing
either.

### NAMES
Tusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most
are made up of harsh, guttural sounds. Tuskens do not
use surnames.
