### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as hunter-gatherers. They possess dense bodies that are heavier than they appear. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They have a unique blood filtration system with two livers, making them highly resistant to toxins. Inhaling sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Devaronian males are driven by wanderlust, often traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. In contrast, female Devaronians tend to stay in one place, raising children and running the government. The males send money back to support their families but rarely return, a situation the females are content with as they view restless males as disruptive.

### NAMES
Devaronian names are dark, complex, and often guttural, with harsh tones interspersed.
