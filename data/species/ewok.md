### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging
about one meter in height, which can provide an
advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur
from head to toe, with brown and black the most
common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or
reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade
an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur,
though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright
eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess
two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their
small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to
overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance
has been likened to "little bears," though they are
sometimes referred to as "mini Wookiees."

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest
moon, in villages built between the closely spaced
trees. The basic design of a tree village has a "Central
Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs.
These huts are high enough above the ground to be
out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect
the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted
rope ladders allow access up or down.
Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during
celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend
to make use of everything they get their hands on; they
use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other
instruments in their music.
