### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the
planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over
eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick,
shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties
that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and
white. The species has two sexes, female and male.
The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye
colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown,
or red.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore,
their notion of "family" encompassed much more than
just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was
the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life
was saved by someone else, regardless of the species,
they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime
of service to their savior and their family. Through the
mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees
used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon
companions and true friends, forming a "honor family."

### NAMES
Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple
and short while others are long and complicated. The
majority of names often have softer big sounds and
more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have
trouble using wookiees' real names, they often adopt
simpler nicknames to go by.
