### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The mon calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species
with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large,
goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the mon
calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on
its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one
opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two
very short outer fingers. Although they are shaped like
flippers, their feet can nevertheless fit into boots
designed for human-like feet. The females are
distinguished from the males by their more prominent
chest areas.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
The mon calamari have developed a very advanced
and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and
science show a creativity surpassed by few in the
galaxy. Mon calamari literature depicts stars as islands
in a galactic sea, showing a passionate longing to
explore space and discover other civilizations. Mon
Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to
anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain
their concentration without being distracted by
emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and
creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being
both determined and dedicated; once a mon calamari
decides on a course of action, they are not easily
swayed from that decision. They often fixate
themselves on "lost causes."
