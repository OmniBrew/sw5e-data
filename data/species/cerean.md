### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Cereans are distinguished by their enlarged skulls, which house complex binary brains. This binary structure aids Cereans in pondering two sides of an issue simultaneously, processing information rapidly, and concentrating deeply. Their extra heart supplies sufficient blood to their brains. Despite their quick-thinking nature and reflexes, Cereans are usually not as well-coordinated as humans.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Cereans have developed a low-tech society on their homeworld, Cerea, and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea is crucial to them. They are permitted to use off-world technology in Outsider Citadels, but it cannot be removed from there. Meditation, often assisted by kasha crystals, is a core part of a Cerean's daily ritual. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, which provides exceptional focus during intense physical combat.
