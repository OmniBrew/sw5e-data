### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
A humanoid sentient species, Lasats are notable for their impressive height, strength, and agility, with their muscular digitigrade legs enabling them to run faster, jump higher and farther, and move more quietly than humans. Their large finger pads and prehensile toes assist them in climbing. In addition, their large eyes and ears afford them superior sight and hearing over humans. They had the strength to open a powered-down blast door. A height of two meters tall was considered below-average for a Lasat.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Lasat society is held together by a long-standing oral tradition, featuring clever and stealthy heroes. Within the species, those with fighting skills are highly respected, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard, a group of highly trained, highly intelligent warriors sworn to protect their homeworld of Lira San. Bo-rifles are a long-standing tradition in Lasat culture, used exclusively by the Honor Guard of Lasan. The warrior way of the Lasat is the Boosahn Keeraw. When a Lasat is bested by a superior opponent in combat, they would give them their weapon.

Facial hair is an important status symbol in Lasat culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes are considered to be attractive by others of their species. Juvenile Lasat are noted to climb tree branches.
