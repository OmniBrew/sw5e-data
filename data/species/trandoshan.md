### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with
scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard
year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded
reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied
color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see
far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs
ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for
combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity,
making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat
clumsy and awkward.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper,
whom they would appease through acts which
increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living
a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards,
overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to
become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers.
Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which
consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath
points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous
wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in
Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a
hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively
making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper.
They could, however, win all those points back by
killing the one who zeroed their score.

### NAMES
Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of
elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences
between male and female names are often very subtle,
but there is a higher chance for female names to
contain softer sounds.
