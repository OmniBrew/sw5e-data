### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
In their natural form, clawdites resemble reptilian humanoids, having evolved from reptomammals. They have sunken cheeks with a narrow nose, a small mouth, large eyes with slit-like pupils, and a thin line that runs down their foreheads, creasing their nose. Clawdites possess an extremely rare ability to change their appearance. They can change the color and texture of their skin and eyes, and even grow hair, to mimic other species, though they cannot add significant physical mass to their bodies.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
By nature, clawdites are quiet and solitary beings, often shunning the company of others unless it benefits them. Due to their nature as shapeshifters, they are often mistrusted by strangers. Consequently, they view the galaxy pragmatically, and are often harsh realists.

Not all clawdites use their shapeshifting abilities due to the pain the transformation causes. These clawdites are often inclined to remain on their homeworld of Zolan, avoiding the company of other species.

On Zolan, clawdites are feared and shunned by the zolanders, who are a deeply religious people, believing that clawdites are impure and sinful. Zolanders force clawdites to live in slums scattered across the planet.

Those clawdites who leave their homeworld tend to gravitate toward professions that celebrate their shapeshifting, such as smuggling, bounty hunting, or espionage.

### NAMES
Clawdite names often have a rolling or hissing quality to them. Surnames are familial, though clawdites rarely use them.
