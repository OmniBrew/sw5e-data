### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Tarasins are tall reptilians covered in translucent scales that allows the species’ color-changing skin below to show through. Tarasins also have a colorful fan of flesh and scales known as a kampo that opens around their heads when they experience strong emotional distress, which can be a detriment to negotiations, as it is difficult for a tarasin to hide discomfort. This color-changing ability is useful for camouflage and communication, and the scales naturally repel heat. Some examples of colors they take on include being brown when calm and in a comfortable environment, or becoming red after extended exertion or when excited. Tarasins also have short spines that protrude from their forearms known as a sa’tosin which give the creatures the ability to sense the use of the Force. Tarasins are naturally curious and protective but also slow to anger. What they lack in sheer physical strength they make up for with a brilliant intellect.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Tarasins live in a tribal system in the jungle underbrush of Cularin, grouping together in clans called irstat. The tarasin believe they have a symbiotic relationship with Cularin, and their religion is based around the appreciation of the natural world. This closeness with their homeworld is what makes the tarasin reluctant to leave it for an extended time. The tarasin have a strong connection with the Force, and their spiritual leaders are often able to call upon the Force in small ways. The tarasin believe that the ch’hala tree is sacred. This may have been influenced by the trees having a similar ability to shift their colors as the tarasin, but it is also the most unique tree on Cularin.

### NAMES
Tarasin names are generally very soft and melodic. Names are agendered, and surnames are not used.
