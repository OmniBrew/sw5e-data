### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Nautolans possess physiology common to amphibious
species, including low light vision and excellent
swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense
cartilage make them tough and resistant to glancing
blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from
their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and
head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the
same size as a Human infant during this time, their
limbs are weak and unable to support their weight,
forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic
environments for much of their childhood.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
The society developed by the Nautolans on Glee
Anselm is centralized around local families and
governments. The centralized government of Glee
Anselm is comprised of representatives from the
Council of Elders that govern each settlement. Elders
are elected on merit, and can be made up of youthful
politicians as well as the most aged members of the
society. A culture that promotes life-long mates,
Nautolan families are characterized by their loyalty
between spouses and the equality of the sexes in the
household. Arranged marriages are not uncommon.
No cultural anity for the Force ever developed on
Glee Anselm, though members of the Nautolan species
recognize its importance and respected those among
them that were Forceful.
