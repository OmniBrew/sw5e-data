### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The duros are humanoids with smooth blue-green
skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces
and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes
are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females
and males are bald, though both genders are easily
distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit
pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended
from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub
stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of
their offspring from birth.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to
massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is
covered with automated farms for food production.
The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the
planet.
The duros also established a vast, grand starship
construction industry in the Duro system. The duros
set up their government around a consortium of
starship construction corporations, with all important
political decisions made by the stockholders of the
corporations. This meant that any duros that held
stock in a company could participate in the
administration of the system.
With their strong memories, some duros also choose
to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned
galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of
narratives by heart, and perform them all with
stunning accuracy.
