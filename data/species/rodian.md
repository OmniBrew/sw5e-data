### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
The rodians are green-skinned humanoids from the
planet Rodia. They possess distinctive faces: large,
round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair
of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which
served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts
augmented the rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses,
collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically
large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and
were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the
spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active
lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition,
normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy
rodians became complacent and obese.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death,
due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since
their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle
homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring
rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of
their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian
villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting
tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their
culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other
predators on the planet to near extinction, they began
to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial
contests.
