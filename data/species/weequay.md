### BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE
Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that
ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are
lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.

### SOCIETY AND CULTURE
Weequays have the ability to communicate with
members of their own clan through smell by exuding
complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can
not be understood by any other species, or even by
Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even
tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each
Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no
need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is
only a secondary form of communication for Weequay,
and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in
Humans mistakenly believing the species to be
unintelligent.
Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid
each year spent away from their homeworld as a
tribute to their home. When they returned, they
shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were
often very close to their homeworld, and would only
have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually
bald, and did not follow this tradition.

### NAMES
Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or
among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even
then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In
Weequay culture, individual identity is much less
important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a
single Weequay is expendable. This results in a
sometimes brutal culture.
