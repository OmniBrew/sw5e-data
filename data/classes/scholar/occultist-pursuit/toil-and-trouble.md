_**Occultist Pursuit:** 17th level_
You perfect your control of your curses, granting them unmatched potency. When the target of your Curse of 
Objurgation fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.
Additionally, when a creature attempts to use a power like *remove curse* or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.
