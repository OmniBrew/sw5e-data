_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 9th level_
Your strength in the Force and your ability to read the objects around you intensifies. You can use your Critical Analysis to analyze an object of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. When you do so, you learn whether or not the object is enhanced, cursed, and how old it is. 
Additionally, you can end your Critical Analysis on the object (no action required) to ask it a single question and receive an answer, usually in the form of an auditory or visual hallucination. For example, touching the rusted, broken remains of a lightsaber and asking how it got there may result in a brief vision of a disgruntled Jedi Knight casting it to the ground on that spot. An object �questioned� in this way can only provide information relating to its past. The GM has the final say on what objects can be questioned, and to what extent.
You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
