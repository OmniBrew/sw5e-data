_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 6th level_
You have unlocked more control over the Force, allowing you to choose wisely who it affects. When you cast a force power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
