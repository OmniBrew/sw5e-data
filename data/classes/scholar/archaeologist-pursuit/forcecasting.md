_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_
You have learned powers from your studies of civilizations that were also once close to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.
#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.
#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your scholar level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table, + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.
#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table.
You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.
#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Intelligence or Wisdom for light side powers (your choice), Intelligence or Charisma for dark side powers (your choice), and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
___
**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
___
**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
