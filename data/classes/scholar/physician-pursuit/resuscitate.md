_**Physician Pursuit:** 9th level_
Through your medical studies you have learned to delay seemingly inevitable death. As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points. 
Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
