_**Physician Pursuit:** 17th level_
You've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.
The target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.
Once you create a panacea, you can't create another until you finish a long rest.
