_**Physician Pursuit:** 6th and 11th level_
Whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can roll an additional d6 and add it to the roll. This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.
Additionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 11th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
