_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_
Your unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.
Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
Finally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.
