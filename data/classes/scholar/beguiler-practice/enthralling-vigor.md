_**Beguiler Practice:** 13th level_
Whenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).
You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
