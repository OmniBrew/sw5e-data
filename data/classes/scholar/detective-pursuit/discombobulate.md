_**Detective Pursuit:** 17th level_
When you use a scholar maneuver on a hostile creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
