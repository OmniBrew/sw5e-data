_**Slicer Pursuit:** 9th level_
When the target of your Critical Analysis feature casts a tech power that affects an area, you can use your reaction to cause that power to instead affect an area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the caster. 
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
