_**Slicer Pursuit:** 17th level_
You know how to quickly activate anti-tech subroutines you have encoded into your wristpad. You can cast the *diminish tech* and *tech override* powers at 3rd level without expending tech points. If the target is the target of your Critical Analysis, you have advantage on the techcasting ability check for these powers.
You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
