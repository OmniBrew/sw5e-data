_**Gunslinger Practice:** 9th level_
You can flourish your weapon in an intimidating or charming manner. As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.
