_**Gunslinger Practice:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You learn to quickly move into cover when under fire. Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.
You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
