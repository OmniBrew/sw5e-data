_**Politician Pursuit:** 9th level_
You may use to a bonus action to call your allies towards you. When you do so, choose a number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you equal to your Critical Analysis ability modifier (minimum of one). They can use their reaction to immediately move a number of feet equal to their speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and they must end this movement closer to you than they started.
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
