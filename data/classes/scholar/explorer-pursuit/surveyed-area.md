You can now use your Critical Analysis feature on a 15-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, and when a creature ends your Critical Analysis feature on themself, it does not end this effect for other creatures in your Surveyed Area.
