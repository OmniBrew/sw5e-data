_**Chef Pursuit:** 3rd level_
You are prepared to assist allies with specially prepared, instantly effective supplements. When an ally is the target of your Critical Analysis feature and within 5 feet of you, you may expend a superiority die and give that ally the benefits of any discovery that utilizes a superiority die and is exclusive to the Chef Pursuit, regardless of whether or not you've chosen it. 
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
