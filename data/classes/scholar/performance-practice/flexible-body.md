_**Performance Practice:** 9th level_
You are able to use your acrobatic talent to gain the upper hand in combat. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to shove or trip a creature. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 
Additionally, you now ignore difficult terrain, you can move through space occupied by hostile creatures, and you can squeeze through smaller spaces without expending extra movement.
