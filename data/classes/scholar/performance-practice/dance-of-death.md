_**Performance Practice:** 13th level_
You can use your action to make a weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can choose to deal Sneak Attack damage to each creature you hit, but you can only roll half your number of Sneak Attack dice per creature.
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
