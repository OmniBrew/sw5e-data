_**Tactician Pursuit:** 9th level_
You become a master at leading your allies around in a battlefield you have studied. When you spend 10 minutes observing an area that is within 120 feet from you, or by using a detailed map, select a number of creatures up to your Critical Analysis ability modifier. You and those selected allies ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in that area.
