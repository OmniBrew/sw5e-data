_**Geneticist Pursuit:** 6th level_
When you target yourself with your Critical Analysis feature, you can choose to undergo a mutagenic transformation. Your form shifts, exaggerating and strengthening your geneticist discoveries for 1 hour. You gain the following benefits:
- You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
- Your Strength score becomes equal to your Critical Analysis score.
- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
You can end this effect early on your turn as a bonus action. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
