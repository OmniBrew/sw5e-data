_**Construction Engineering:** 14th level_
You can spend 1 hour inspecting and looking over a structure you can see from every angle available to you and comparing it to data you have on hand. At the end of the hour, you learn the basic blueprints for the structure, including but not limited to:
- The structure's total hit points.
- Any common materials that make up the structures.
- Whether or not the structure is in use or abandoned.
- The total floor count for the structure, as well as the general purpose of each floor if it was created to suit a specific purpose.
- All non-secret entrances (including doors, windows, vents, pipe systems) and where you could find them.
- A basic map-layout of every floor and ventilation system for the building.
- The history of the building such as what company or species could have constructed it, as well as how long it's been built.
- Any structural weak points it might have.
Additionally, when you make an Investigation check while searching this structure for hidden structural elements, such as doors or passages, if you have constructor's implements, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
