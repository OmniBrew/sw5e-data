_**Artificer Engineering:** 14th level_
When you hit a creature that is concentrating on a power with your modified lightsaber, the creature has disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature immediately takes psychic damage equal to your engineer level + your Intelligence modifier.
