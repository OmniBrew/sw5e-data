_**Astrotech Engineering:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
Your mastery of droids improves your ability to manipulate them. When you cast a power that could affect only droids or constructs, and you only affect droids with the power, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.
You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
