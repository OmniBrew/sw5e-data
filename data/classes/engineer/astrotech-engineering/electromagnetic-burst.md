_**Astrotech Engineering:** 18th level_
As an action, you can end your field in a electromagnetic burst of power with an effect determined by the field you were generating.
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
#### Ionizing Burst
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 ion damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned.
#### Jamming Burst
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Once in the next minute, when a chosen creature fails a saving throw caused by a tech power or is hit by an attack power, the creature can choose to succeed on the saving throw or have the attack miss instead.
#### Targeting Burst
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC or be blinded for 1d4+1 turns.
