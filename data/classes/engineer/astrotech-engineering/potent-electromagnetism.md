_**Astrotech Engineering:** 3rd level_
Once per round, when you deal damage to a droid or construct, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as the source of the damage.
The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.
