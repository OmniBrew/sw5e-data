_**Biochem Engineering:** 14th level_
As a reaction when you take damage from a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see, you can use one of your mixtures. The effects of the mixture release in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you, and if the mixture requires a saving throw, you automatically succeed on it. Additionally, the affected area is difficult terrain to creatures other than you until the end of your next turn.
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
