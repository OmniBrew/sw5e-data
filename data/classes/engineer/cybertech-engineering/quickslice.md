***Cybertech Engineering:** 6th level* 
When a creature you can see casts a tech power, you may use your reaction to attempt to download that tech power to your wristpad for later use if it is of a level for which you can cast. 
Make an ability check using your techcasting ability with proficiency. The DC equals 10 + two times the powerâ€™s level. On a success you store the power for later use. On a failure, the power is not stored. You can cast powers stored in your wristpad as if you had learned them and they do not count against your tech powers known.
Once you have used this feature on a creature, you cannot do so again on the same creature until you complete a short or long rest.
You can store an amount of levels worth of tech powers equal to your engineer level at a time. Additionally, you can choose replace or remove one or more tech powers learned by this feature each time you use it.
