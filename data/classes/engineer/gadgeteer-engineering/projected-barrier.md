_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 3rd level_
As a bonus action while wearing your gadgeteer harness, you can expend a use of your Potent Aptitude to project a barrier on a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet. A creature can only have one barrier active at a time.
#### Environmental Barrier
You project an environmental barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. 
#### Physical Barrier
You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of energy, ion, or kinetic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage.
