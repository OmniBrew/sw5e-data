_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 14th level_
When you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.
