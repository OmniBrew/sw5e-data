_**Astrotech Engineering:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_
You employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and bond with your own droid companion.
Create your droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.
In addition to its traits and features, your droid companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:
- Your droid is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.
- Your droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, when you would use your action to cast a 1st-level tech power, you can instead have your droid companion cast it. You still expend tech points as normal, and if the power requires concentration, it still uses your concentration. Your droid companion must use its action, and it uses its tech attack modifier and tech save DC instead of your own. At 5th level, your droid can cast 2nd-level tech powers in this way. This increases to 3rd-level powers at 9th level, 4th-level powers at 13th level, and 5th-level powers at 17th level. When you cast a power, you consume a number of uses of this feature equal to that power's level.
At 11th level, your droid companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your droid companion must be within 60 feet.
You can use this feature four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
