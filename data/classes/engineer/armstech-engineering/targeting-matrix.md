_**Armstech Engineering:** 14th and 17th level_
When you cast a tech power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw, you can instead make an attack roll with your modified weapon against a single target that would be in the range of the power. On a hit, the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw. If the power would affect more than one creature, it instead affects only one.
You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
