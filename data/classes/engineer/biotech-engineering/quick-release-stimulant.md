_**Biotech Engineering:** 3rd level_
When you are dealt damage by an attack while you have at least one cybernetic augmentation installed, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to reduce the damage you take. The damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Constitution modifier + your engineer level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining damage reduction.
