_**Biotech Engineering:** 6th level_
You've learned to use your body as a conduit for your tech powers. When you cast a tech power, you can choose to pay up to half the cost of the tech power using your hit points instead of your tech points. When you do so, your maximum hit points are reduced by the same amount until you complete a long rest.
