_**Rakatan Order:** 11th level_
You can use your Focus features using your tech points. When you do so, your maximum tech points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.
Additionally, you are constantly under the effects of the *detect enhancement* tech power. As an action, you can cast the *analyze* tech power without expending tech points. When you do so, *detect enhancement* is suppressed and you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
