_**Teras Kasi Order:** 3rd level_
Your honed focus allows you to enter a stance of mental fortification and power. You can use your bonus action to enter this stance. When you do so, you unleash a flurry of blows on creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage.
This stance lasts for 1 minute. While you are in this stance, you gain the following benefits:
- **Death Weave.** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your focus ability modifier + half your monk level.
- **Gundark Slap.** Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can choose to make it unable to take reactions until the end of your next turn.
- **Sleeping Krayt.** You can use your focus ability modifier instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength check or a Strength saving throw. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
These effects end early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 focus point to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.
