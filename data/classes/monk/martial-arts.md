_**Monk:** 1st level_ 
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are vibroweapons with which you are proficient that lack the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
- Your unarmed strikes and monk weapons gain the finesse property.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.
- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. 
- You can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action.
> ##### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons
> If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the weapon lacks the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.
