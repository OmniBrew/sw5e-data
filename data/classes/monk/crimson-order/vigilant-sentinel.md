_**Crimson Order:** 11th level_
When you attempt to perceive your surroundings on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, you gain a +10 bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect.
