_**Echani Order:** 6th level_
You extend your focus into your Echani weapons, granting you the following benefits.
#### Enhanced Echani Weapons
Your attacks with your Echani weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
#### Deft Strike
When you hit a target with an Echani weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
