_**Kage Order:** 6th level_
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack when you have advantage, or it fails a saving throw against an effect that you control, you can choose to roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the amount rolled.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
