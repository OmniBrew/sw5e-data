_**Jal Shey Order:** 6th level_
You can hit a series of hidden nerves on a creature with precision, temporarily causing them to be unable to mask their true thoughts and intent. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can have the attack deal no damage and spend 1 focus point to force them to make a Charisma saving throw against your focus save DC. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie for 1 minute and all Charisma checks directed at the creature are made with advantage for the duration. 
On a success or failure, a creature is aware that you attempted to influence them. They can choose to avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie.
