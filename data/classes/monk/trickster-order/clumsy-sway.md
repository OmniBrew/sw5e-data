_**Trickster Order:** 6th level_
You can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.
***Leap to Your Feet.*** When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
***Redirect Attack.*** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 focus point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.
