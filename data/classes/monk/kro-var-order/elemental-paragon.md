You gain one of the following features. 
Once you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

_**Prerequisite:** Ride the Wind_
As an action, you conjure a whirlwind around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:

- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.
