_**Matukai Order:** 3rd level_
You learn to channel the Force into your unarmed strikes and monk weapons, further enhancing your melee strikes. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or melee weapon attack with a monk weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your focus save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 force damage and is pushed up to 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature only takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
