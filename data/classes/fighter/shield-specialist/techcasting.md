_**Shield Specialist:** 3rd level_
You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.
#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.
#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to half your fighter level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.
#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table.
You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.
#### Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
___
**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
___
**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a tech focus for your tech powers.
