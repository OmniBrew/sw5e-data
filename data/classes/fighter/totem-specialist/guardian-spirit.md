_**Totem Specialist:** 7th level_
You learn to invoke your totems to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the creature's AC against that attack. The bonus equals 1 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +2).
