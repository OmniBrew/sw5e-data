_**Tactical Specialist:** 3rd level_
You can use each maneuver twice per turn, instead of once.
Additionally, choose two maneuvers you know. The chosen maneuvers count as general maneuvers for you. You can choose another maneuver at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these maneuvers with another maneuver you know.
