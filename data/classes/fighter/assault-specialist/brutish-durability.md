_**Assault Specialist:** 7th level_
Once per round, roll 1d6 and add the die to your saving throw total. If applying this bonus to a death saving throw increases the total to 20 or higher, you gain the benefits of rolling a 20 on the d20. You can choose to use this feature before or after you make a saving throw, but you must decide before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.
