_**Exhibition Specialist:** 7th level_
As you defeat your enemies in combat, you can weaken the morale of other foes or bolster the resolve of your allies alike. When you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose one or more creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen 
creatures are affected by one of the following effects of your choice:
- The creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.
