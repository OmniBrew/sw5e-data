_**Exhibition Specialist:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You're a master at dazzling your friends and enemies alike. When you would make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma  check, you can roll a d4 and add it to the roll. On a success, you can immediately choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you up to your Charisma modifier (no action required, minimum of one). Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. This effects ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.
This die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
