_**Blademaster Specialist:** 3rd level_
You've learned to make adaptations to your fighting style on the fly. You have three such effects: Change Up, Draw, and Stow. When you use your Adaptive Fighting, you choose which effect to create.
You can use this features a number of times equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.
#### Change Up
You can use your object interaction and expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting to change the Fighting Style option granted to you by your fighter class feature.
#### Draw
When you use your object interaction to draw one or more weapons, you can expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting (no action required) to increase your critical hit range by 1 with the weapon(s) until the start of your next turn.
#### Stow
When you use your object interaction to stow a weapon, you can expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting (no action required) to take the Disengage action.
