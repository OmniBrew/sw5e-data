_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_
You learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.
#### Ammunition Enhancements
You know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under "Ammunition Enhancements" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,
You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.
Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.
#### Amplified Shots
You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.
#### Saving Throws
Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
___
**Ammunition save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
