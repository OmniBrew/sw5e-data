_**Mounted Specialist:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is dealt damage by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.
You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
