_**Armored Approach:** 6th level_
You customize your spiked armor to better protect you. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. While wearing your spiked armor, you have resistance to damage of the chosen type. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different damage type, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.
Additionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat or cold.
