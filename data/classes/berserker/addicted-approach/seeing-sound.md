_**Addicted Approach:** 10th level_
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you instead have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. If you would already have blindsight, it instead increases by 5 feet or 15 feet, respectively.
