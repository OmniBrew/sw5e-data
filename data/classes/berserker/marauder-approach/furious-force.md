_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_
You can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast that require a force attack or saving throw. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. 
Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires a force attack.
