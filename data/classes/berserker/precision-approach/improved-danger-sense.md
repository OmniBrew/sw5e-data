_**Precision Approach:** 10th level_
While raging, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers, you are treated as proficient in the save, and you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
