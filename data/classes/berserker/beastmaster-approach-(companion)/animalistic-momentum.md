_**Beastmaster Approach:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_
Your bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 10 feet of you:
- If you or your beast have a climbing or swimming speed and the other doesn't, the other gains it with the same speed. If you both have the a climbing or swimming speed, you both use the larger speed of the two, which then increases by 5 feet.
- Whenever your beast deals damage to a hostile creature you can see on your turn, it counts as you taking a hostile action for the purposes of maintaining your rage.
This radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level 60 feet at 17th level.
