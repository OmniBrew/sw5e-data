_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_
You learn to capitalize on a primal attunement to nature to forge a powerful bond with your own beast companion.
Create your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. 
In addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:
- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your number of available Hit Dice that can be spend to restore hit points is reduced by 1.
Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains the benefits of one of your chosen instincts. If that instinct relies on raging, your beast companion gains the benefits of that instinct while you are raging.
At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.
