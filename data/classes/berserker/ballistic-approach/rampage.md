_**Ballistic Approach:** 6th level_
While raging, when you deal damage with a blaster with which you are proficient, and you added your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed towards your target. You must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.
