_**Ballistic Approach:** 14th level_

When you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage, instead of just one. Additionally, when a Large or smaller creature fails the saving throw against your burst or rapid property while within 30 feet of you, it is knocked prone.
