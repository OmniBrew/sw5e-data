_**Ballistic Approach:** 3rd and 9th level_

While raging, you gain the following benefits:

- Your blaster weapon damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.

- You add your rage damage to damage rolls from ranged weapon attacks using Strength. 

- At 9th level, when a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against your burst or rapid property, you can add your Brutal Critical dice to the damage.
