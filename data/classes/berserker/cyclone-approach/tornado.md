_**Cyclone Approach:** 14th and 17th level_

Once on each of your turns, you can become a tornado of attacks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your regular attacks to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand, each successful hit against a target deals damage equal to the damage dice of both weapons + your ability modifier + any other modifiers.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
