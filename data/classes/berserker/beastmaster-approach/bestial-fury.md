_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_
While raging, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks.
Additionally, once on each of your turns while raging, you can mark a creature you can see as your prey for the duration of your rage (no action required). When you do so, once per turn when you deal damage to the creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 damage of the same type. Once per turn when the creature deals damage to you with a weapon attack, you take an additional 1d4 damage of the same type. This die increases to d6 at 5th level, d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
