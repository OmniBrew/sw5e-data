_**Warchief Approach:** 10th level_
You learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to their next Initiative check, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.
