_**Cyclone Approach:** 6th level_
Your unpredictable movement makes you harder to hit and pin down. When you make a saving throw or ability checks to avoid being knocked prone, pushed, grappled, or restrained, it gains a bonus equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.
