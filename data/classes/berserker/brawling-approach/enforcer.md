_**Brawling Approach:** 14th level_
When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.
## Cyclone Approach
The Cyclone Approach empowers the berserker's ability to fight with weapons in each hand. Followers of this approach learn to move quickly to avoid attacks and can become a whirlwind of fury and steel, cleaving through hordes of enemies.
