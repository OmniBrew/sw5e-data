_**Brawling Approach:** 10th level_
You can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. 
Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.
