_**Juggernaut Approach:** 3rd level_
Your momentum makes you nigh unstoppable. While raging, you can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size. When you do so, you must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you move at least 10 feet before moving through a hostile creature's space, and that creature is your size or smaller, they have disadvantage on the check. If you succeed, you don't treat the movement as difficult terrain, the creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice, and you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your turn.
