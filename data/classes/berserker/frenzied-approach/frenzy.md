_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_
You can go into a frenzy when you enter your rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one.
The first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion when your rage ends each time you use it.
When you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2, instead of 1. Additionally, any effect that removes exhaustion reduces your exhaustion by 1 additional level.
