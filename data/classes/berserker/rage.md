_**Berserker:** 1st level_
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.
While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the berserker table.
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.
If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't taken a hostile action or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
You can enter a rage a number of times as shown in the Rages column of the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
