_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_
You can use the force to quickly learn the use of unfamiliar weapons. When you hold a weapon that you are not proficient in, you can spend 1 force point (no action required) to gain proficiency with that weapon until the end of your next long rest. 
Additionally, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range.
