_**Path of the Corsair:** 7th level_
You learn to easily detonate primed explosives. As a bonus action on your turn, you can detonate a primed explosive you can see within 60 feet. Alternatively, if you take the Attack action on your turn and you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to shoot the explosive rather than use your bonus action to detonate it as long as you wouldn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
When you do so, the explosive immediately detonates, and you have advantage on the damage roll you make with that explosive.
