_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_
You can throw grenades and set mines with your bonus action, instead of your action. Additionally, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range. Lastly, when determining the save DC of a charge, grenade, mine, missile, or rocket you control, you can use your universal force save DC, if it would be higher than the item's DC.
