_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_
You learn the *force disarm* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option to deal kinetic damage when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, when you cast the *force disarm* force power, disarm a blaster weapon, and catch it, you can reload the weapon as a part of the same action.
