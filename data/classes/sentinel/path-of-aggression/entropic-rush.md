_**Path of Aggression:** 7th level_
You've learned to move with speed and precision, discharging your lightning in a massive burst. When you move at least half your speed before casting *lightning charge*, you make the attack roll with advantage. Additionally, on a hit, the lightning can leap a second time, to a third creature within range or back to the first creature.
