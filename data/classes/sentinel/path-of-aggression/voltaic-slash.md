_**Path of Aggression:** 3rd level_
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *lightning charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and when you deal lightning damage with the *lightning charge* force power, you deal additional lightning damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
