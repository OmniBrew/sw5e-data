_**Path of Aggression:** 13th level_
You've learned to channel the damage done to you to enhance your strikes. The first time you deal damage on your turn, if you took damage since the start of your last turn, you can deal additional lightning damage equal to your Kinetic Combat die + half the amount of damage taken.
You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
