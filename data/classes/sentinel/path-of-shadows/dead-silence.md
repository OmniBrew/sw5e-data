_**Path of Shadows:** 3rd level_
You learn the *psychic charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and when you hit a creature with the *psychic charge* force power and the target tries to speak, it takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1), and its voice does not produce sound until the end of your next turn.
