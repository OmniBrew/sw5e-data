_**Path of the Forceblade:** 3rd level_
You learn the *saber throw* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you no longer have disadvantage on the attack roll with it if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit a target. Finally, when you hit a creature with the *saber throw* force power, you deal additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
