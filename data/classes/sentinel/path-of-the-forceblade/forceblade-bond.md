_**Path of the Forceblade:** 3rd level_
You learn how to bond with a light- or vibro-weapon through the Force, making it part of you.
You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond, gaining the following benefits:
- You can't be disarmed of that weapon while you are conscious. 
- If the weapon is within 60 feet of you and you can see it, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to travel instantly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.
- You can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.
You can have two weapons bonded to you in this way at a time, and you can summon both of them to you with the same bonus action.
