_**Path of the Forceblade:** 13th level_
When you are the target of a ranged attack, and the source is within range of your *saber throw* force power, you can use your reaction to throw your forceblade at the source of the attack. Make a ranged force attack. On a hit, this attack deals damage using your Kinetic Combat die instead of the weapon's damage die and you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.
