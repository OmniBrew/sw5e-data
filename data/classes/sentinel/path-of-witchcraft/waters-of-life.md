_**Path of Witchcraft:** 13th and 17th level_
You've learned to absorb the fleeting magicks of your familiar. When your familiar is destroyed by taking damage, you can choose to grant temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to one friendly creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet.
You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
