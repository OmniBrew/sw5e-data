_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_
You've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.
Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.
Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Double Strike Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.
