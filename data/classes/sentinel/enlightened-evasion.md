_**Sentinel:** 15th level_
When you are subjected to an effect that forces you to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 force points to add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to the saving throw. If you do so, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
