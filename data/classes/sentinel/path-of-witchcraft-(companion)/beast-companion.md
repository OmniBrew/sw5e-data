_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_
You learn to create a powerful bond through the Force with your own  beast companion.
Create your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content.
In addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:
- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2. 
Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains the following benefits:
- When you use a Force-Empowered Self option to increase your speed or armor class, you can instead grant this bonus to your beast companion. 
- You and your beast companion can communicate telepathically, though your beast companion can only communicate in and understand simple concepts.
This radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.
