_**Path of Witchcraft:** 7th level_
You've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:
- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.
- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.
- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
