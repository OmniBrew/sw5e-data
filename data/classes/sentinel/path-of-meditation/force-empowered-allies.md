_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_
While you are concentrating on a power that benefits a friendly creature other than you, you gain new ways to utilize your Force-Empowered Self features. Each option costs 1 force point, and you can only target a creature that is benefiting from a power you cast.
#### Deflection
When an ally is hit with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to add it to your ally's AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.
#### Double Strike
When an ally hits with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to deal additional damage of the same type as the attack.
#### Slow Time
When an ally moves on their turn, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of the turn.
