_**Path of Meditation:** 7th level_
Once per long rest, you can cast the *battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).
Additionally, whenever you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
