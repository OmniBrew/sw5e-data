_**Path of Meditation:** 13th level_
Once per long rest, you can cast the *improved battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *improved battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).
Additionally, once per round, when a creature rolls a bonus or penalty die from an effect you control, you can have them roll the die with advantage or disadvantage (your choice).
