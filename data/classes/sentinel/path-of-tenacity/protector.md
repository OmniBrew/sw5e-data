_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_
You learn the *saber ward* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, when you cast it, you can spend 2 force points to extend the benefits to creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you while the power is active. The creatures immediately lose this benefit if they move more than 5 feet away from you.
