_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_
Your connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self option, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take true damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.
