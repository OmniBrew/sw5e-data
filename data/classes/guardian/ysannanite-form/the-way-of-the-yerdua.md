_**Ysannanite Form:** 3rd level_
As a bonus action, you can take a meditative stance for 1 minute, granting you supreme accuracy as you guide your shots to their target through the Force. While in this stance, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) to one ranged weapon attack and damage roll you make each turn. Additionally, when making a ranged weapon attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. 
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
