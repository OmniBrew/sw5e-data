_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_
You gain one of the following Channel the Force options. Choose Blade Barrier for Shien or Falling Avalanche for Djem So.
#### Blade Barrier
On your turn, when you deal melee weapon damage that includes your Strength modifier, you can forgo your Strength modifier to the damage roll, expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required), and reduce your speed by half. If you do so, energy and kinetic damage you take from weapons before the end of your next turn is reduced by an amount equal to your Strength modifier. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.
#### Falling Avalanche
On your turn, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required) and reduce your speed by half to gain advantage on the next ability check or attack roll you make using Strength before the end of your next turn. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.
