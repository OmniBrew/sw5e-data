_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 15th level_
You gain one of the following features. Choose Precise Reflection for Shien or Brutal Strikes for Djem So.
#### Precise Reflection
When you hit with an attack made by the *saber reflect* power, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.
#### Brutal Strikes
The Force flowing through you grants you incredible strength. Your Force-Empowered Strikes and Improved Force-Empowered Strikes damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7. Additionally, when you spend force points to use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number of points spent.
