_**Niman Form:** 3rd level_
As a bonus action, you can enter a balanced stance for one minute. As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, when you use your action to cast a force power, you can make one melee weapon attack. Additionally, for the duration, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
