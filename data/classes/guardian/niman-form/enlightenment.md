_**Niman Form:** 7th level_
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or you restore hit points to a friendly creature that is at 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
