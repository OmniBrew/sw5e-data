_**Soresu Form:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You learn to fend off strikes directed at you or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to ward the creature if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll 1d8 and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage. 
You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
