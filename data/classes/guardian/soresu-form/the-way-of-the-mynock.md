_**Soresu Form:** 3rd level_
As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance for one minute. As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cast the *saber ward* power. When you do so, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use to cast the *saber reflect* force power. 
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
