You are a duelist of the highest caliber. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage, and you ignore resistance to kinetic and energy damage.
All melee attacks have disadvantage against you.
Your melee weapon attacks inflict an additional damage die.
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
