_**Makashi Form:** 3rd level_

You gain the following Channel the Force option.

#### Makashi Riposte

When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and use your reaction to attempt to deflect the attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your guardian level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack against that creature as a part of the reaction.
