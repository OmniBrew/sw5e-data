_**Trakata Form:** 3rd level_
You gain the following Channel the Force option.
#### Unbalancing Block
When you are hit with a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a lightweapon with which you are proficient, you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Channel the Force to add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
