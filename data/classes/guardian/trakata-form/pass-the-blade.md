_**Trakata Form:** 15th level_
When a creature misses you with an attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one), and you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to the first melee weapon attack and damage rolls you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.
