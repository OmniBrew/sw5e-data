_**Sokan Form:** 7th and 15th level_
If you fail a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll.
Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. At 15th level you can use this feature twice between long rests.
