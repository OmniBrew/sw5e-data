_**Juyo/Vaapad Form:** 3rd level_
As a bonus action, you can take a savage stance, designating one creature you can see within 10 feet of you as your prey for 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new creature.
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.
