_**Juyo/Vaapad Form:** 3rd level_
You gain one of the following Channel the Force options. Choose Snap Aggression for Juyo or Assertive Defense for Vaapad.
#### Snap Aggression
If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to act normally on your first turn.
#### Assertive Defense
When you reduce the damage dealt by a force power to 0 using the *saber reflect* power, and you're wielding a lightweapon or vibroweapon, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to reflect the attack at a target within range, regardless of what type the damage is.
