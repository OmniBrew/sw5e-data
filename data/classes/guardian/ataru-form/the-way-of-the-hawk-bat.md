_**Ataru Form:** 3rd level_
As a bonus action, you can take an aggressive stance, leaping around the battlefield for 1 minute. As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cast the *force jump* power at 1st-level without expending force points. Additionally, when you cast *force jump*, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against each creature within 5 feet of where you land.
This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
