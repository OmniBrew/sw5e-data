_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 3rd level_
You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if your target is greater than 30 feet from you and no enemies are within 5 feet of you. Additionally, standing up from prone now only costs 5 feet of movement.
Additionally, you gain proficiency with two martial blasters of your choice.
