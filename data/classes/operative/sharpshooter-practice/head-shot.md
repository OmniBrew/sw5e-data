_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 9th level_
You are at your deadliest when your enemies are unaware of the danger they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet. 
Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
