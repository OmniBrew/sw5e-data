_**Gunslinger Practice:** 3rd level_
You learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot. 
Some of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 
___
**Trick Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
___
#### Blinding Shot
You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. 
#### Brutal Shot
You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
#### Hampering Shot
You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.
