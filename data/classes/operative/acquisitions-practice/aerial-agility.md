_**Acquisitions Practice:** 13th level_
Your agility in the air grants you the following benefits:
- When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.
- Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.
