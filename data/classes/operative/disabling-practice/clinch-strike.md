_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_
You learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:
- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8), and you can apply your Sneak Attack damage when you hit with an unarmed strike even if it doesn't have the finesse property.
- You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.
