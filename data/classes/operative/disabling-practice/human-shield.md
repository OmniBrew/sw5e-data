_**Disabling Practice:** 9th level_
You learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.
