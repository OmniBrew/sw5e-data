_**Scrapper Practice:** 3rd level_
You gain proficiency in all blasters with the burst or rapid property that lack the two-handed property. Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to one creature dealt damage in this way as long as that creature didn't have advantage on the save.
When you reach 9th level in this class, when multiple creatures fail a saving throw against the burst property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can divide your Sneak Attack dice amongst the targets as you see fit.
