_**Scrapper Practice:** 3rd level_
You learn to use underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.
Some of your upper hand techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 
___
**Upper Hand save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
___
#### Brutal Hit
You attempt to knock the target prone while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
#### Low Blow
You attempt to stun the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.
#### Shank Shot
You attempt to hamper the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.
