_**Shadow Killer Practice:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit, and you can apply a poison as a bonus action.
Additionally, you learn to create a number of special poison vials. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two doses of poison. You must have a poisoner's kit in order to create these doses. Your doses can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.
As an action, you can use one of your doses to coat one vibroweapon, one slug cartridge, or one wrist launcher dart. A creature hit by the coated weapon must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
The quantity and damage of your doses increases at higher levels, to three and 2d4 at 5th level, four and 3d4 at 9th level, five and 4d4 at 13th level, and six and 5d4 at 17th level.
