_**Sawbones Practice:** 3rd level_
You learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.
Some of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 
___
**Debilitating Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
___
#### Bleeding Wound
You attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it takes true damage equal to one Sneak Attack die and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. 
#### Crippling Pain
You attempt to cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. 
#### Hampering Shot
You attempt to hamper the target's movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.
