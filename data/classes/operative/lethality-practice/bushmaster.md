_**Lethality Practice:** 13th level_
You excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight.
You have advantage on initiative checks. Additionally, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.
