_**Performance Practice:** 3rd level_
Your training with music and dancing grants you certain benefits. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and one musical instrument of your choice.
Additionally, while you are not wearing armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, you can add half your Charisma modifier to your AC as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.
