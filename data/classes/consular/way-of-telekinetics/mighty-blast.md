_**Way of Telekinetics:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_
Your force powers batter and blast your enemies with the strength of a hurricane. When you cast a force power of 1st level or higher that deals force or kinetic damage, one creature of your choice damaged by that power must make a Strength saving throw against your universal force save DC or be knocked prone. 
This feature can affect additional creatures when you reach higher levels: two creatures at 11th level and three creatures at 17th level.
