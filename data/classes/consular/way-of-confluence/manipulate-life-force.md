_**Way of Confluence:** 3rd level_
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).
