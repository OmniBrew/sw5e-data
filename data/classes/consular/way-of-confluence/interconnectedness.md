_**Way of Confluence:** 14th and 17th level_
When you cast a 5th level or lower force power that deals damage or restores hit points and targets only one creature, the power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. 
You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
