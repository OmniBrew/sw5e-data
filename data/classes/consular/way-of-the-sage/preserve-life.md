_**Way of the Sage:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
As an action, you can channel the Force and evoke healing energy that restores a number of hit points equal to five times your consular level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its hit point maximum. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.
You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
