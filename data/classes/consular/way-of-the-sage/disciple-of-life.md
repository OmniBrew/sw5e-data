_**Way of the Sage:** 3rd level_
When you cast a force power that restores hit points, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it. 
Additionally, whenever you use a force power of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains extra hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.
