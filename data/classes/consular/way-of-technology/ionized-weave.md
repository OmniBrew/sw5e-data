_**Way of Technology:** 10th level_
When you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can spend force points to cause that power to instead deal ion damage. The number of force points equals half the power's level (round down, minimum of one). If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw.
