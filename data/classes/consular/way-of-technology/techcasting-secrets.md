_**Way of Technology:** 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_
You've learned to mimic technological effects. Choose two tech powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the consular table.
At 7th level, you learn two additional tech powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of the same level.
