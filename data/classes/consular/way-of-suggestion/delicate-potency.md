_**Way of Suggestion:** 10th, 13th, and 17th level_
Your mind-affecting powers are particularly potent. When you cast one of *cloud mind*, *dominate mind*, *mass coerce mind*, and *dominate monster*, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.
You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
