_**Way of Suggestion:** 14th level_
When you cast a force power, you can delay the effects of the force power for up to a number of rounds equal to half your consular level. If you do so, the power immediately takes effect at the start of your turn, after the specified number of rounds have passed.
Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.
