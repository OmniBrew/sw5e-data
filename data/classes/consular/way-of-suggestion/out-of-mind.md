_**Way of Suggestion:** 6th level_
You can erase yourself from a single creature's sight momentarily. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you that you are aware of. That creature must make a  Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, you become invisible to that creature for 1 minute, or until you deal damage to it.
Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
