A Twi’lek in black robes steps on a terrified rodian, who scampers away on the ground. Lightning sparks from his
fingers, illuminating his red and black tattoos. The rodian’s pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the Sith channels
 his lightning into his failed apprentice, leaving nothing but a charred husk behind.

Sitting cross-legged on a dense patch of grass, a miraluka mystic meditates on the Force. With every breath, the trees
sway with a rhythmic breeze. Though she lacks simple vision, she can see the Force as it moves everything around her.

A drably-robed human focuses inward, channeling the Force into the ground around him. Slowly, all the debris within
arms reach rises into the air around him; with a flick of his wrist, he clears the air, sending his projectiles to
pound on the approaching tank.

Consulars are the supreme wielders of the Force, defined and united by the powers they cast. Drawing on the omnipresent
Force that permeates the universe, consulars cast powers of rejuvenating healing and destructive lightning, draining
life-force and manipulating minds; the most powerful with the Force can even experience brief glimpses of the future.

### Strong with the force
Refraining from drawing their lightsabers except as a measure of last resort, consulars spend a great deal of time
studying the mysteries of the Force. Their knowledge allows them to channel the Force to greater heights, unlocking
unrivaled power, and twisting those powers to greater effect.

### Sage or Sorcerer
Consulars who follow the light side of the Force, using their powers to better their communities and people, are often
called sages, while consulars who fall to the dark side and subjugate or cast aside all in their path are commonly
called sorcerers. Alternatively, they may tend toward the middle, refraining from politics and war, spending their
time in isolation and study.

While creating your consular, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous
practitioners - the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path?
Perhaps you were ostracized from your primitive village out of superstition or jealousy. You may have been brutally
trained from a young age in the dark side, fueling your innate thirst for power, or perhaps you were trained as a
padawan in one of the Jedi temples. How do you treat strangers, and how do they treat you once they know your abilities?
What was your family like, or what did you have instead of a family? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an
impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a consular quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or Charisma your highest
ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.
