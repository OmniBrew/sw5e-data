In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an
abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

### FORCE POWERS KNOWN
You learn 9 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known
column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you
may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

### FORCE POINTS
You have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the
consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers.
You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

### MAX POWER LEVEL
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower
these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.

You may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

### FORCECASTING ABILITY
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers,
Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever
a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Force save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

__Force attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
