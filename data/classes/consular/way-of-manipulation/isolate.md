_**Way of Manipulation:** 14th level_
When you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).
