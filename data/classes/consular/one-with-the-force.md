Your attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your
maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can
cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it
once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend force points as normal.
