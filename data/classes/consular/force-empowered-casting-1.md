You gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional
force points to modify the power. You gain two Force-Empowered Casting options, located at the end of the class
description, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force-Empowered Casting Options of the consular table.

You can use only one Force-Empowered Casting option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
