_**Way of Tutelage:** 3rd level_
You've taken an apprentice, gaining the services of your own humanoid companion.
Create your humanoid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. 
In addition to its traits and features, your companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:
- Your companion gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2.
Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, when your companion is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Force Shield feature to shroud it in Force energy. If you do so, until the start of your next turn, both you and your companion gain the benefits of your Force Shield. This includes the triggering attack.
At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.
