_**Way of Tutelage:** 6th level_
When you cast a power that affects only your companion, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
