_**Way of Tutelage:** 14th and 17th level_
Once per turn, when your companion is within 10 feet of you, and both you and your companion have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, either you or your companion can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If either of you do so, the other of the two of you gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.
At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet of you to benefit from this feature.
