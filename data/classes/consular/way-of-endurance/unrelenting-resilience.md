_**Way of Endurance:** 14th level_
When you use your Boundless Vitality feature while concentrating on a force power, you can add the result of the roll to the Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.
Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Upheld by the Force is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
