You have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a
number of force points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier
(your choice, minimum of one). Once youâ€™ve used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
