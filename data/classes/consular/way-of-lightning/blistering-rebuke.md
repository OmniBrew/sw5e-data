_**Way of Lightning:** 10th, 13th, and 17th level_
When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes *shocked* until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved or *shocked*.
You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
