You can increase the power of your simpler lightning force powers. When you cast a force power of 1st through 6th level that deals lightning damage, you can deal maximum damage with that power.

You can use this feature with no adverse effects a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. If you use this feature beyond this before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 true damage for each level of the power, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the damage increases by 1d12.
