You can weave the Force around yourself for protection. When you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher,
you can simultaneously manipulate the Force to create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest.
The barrier has hit points equal to twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).
Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a universal
power of 1st level or higher, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the power.

Once you create the barrier, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.
