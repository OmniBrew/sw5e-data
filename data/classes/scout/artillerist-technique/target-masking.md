_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_
You are familiar with various turrets and defensive emplacements, and their operation. 
As a bonus action, you can activate a masking effect to confuse the targeting of constructs for 1 minute. Any construct who targets you with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the construct must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect you from area effects.
You can use this feature a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
