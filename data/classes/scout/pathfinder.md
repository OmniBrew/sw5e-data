You are skilled at navigating the untamed wilds. You ignore difficult terrain, and when traveling for an hour or more, you gain the following benefits:
- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group, provided they can see and hear you.
- You can't become lost by unenhanced means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food.
- You have advantage on Survival checks.
