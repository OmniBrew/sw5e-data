_**Stalker Technique:** 3rd level_
While you are hidden from the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, the first attack roll you make each round against that creature does not automatically reveal your presence to that creature. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by your target's Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden. If you are less than 30 feet from your target, the Dexterity (Stealth) check is made with disadvantage.
