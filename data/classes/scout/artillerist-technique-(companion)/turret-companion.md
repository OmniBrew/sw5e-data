_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_
You learn to apply your knowledge to construct and bond with your own portable turret.
Create your turret companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have artillerist's implements in order to create your turret.
In addition to its traits and features, your turret companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:
- Your turret is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.
- Your turret gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each turret trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of turret traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one).
- When you would make a weapon attack, you can let your turret make a weapon attack instead.
Lastly, while your turret is bonded, within 10 feet of you, and the target of your *tracker droid interface* tech power, when you cast a tech power with a range of 5 feet or greater, you can cast it as if you were in your turret's space, and the range increases to 10 feet if it isn't greater.
Both the range and radius increase to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.
