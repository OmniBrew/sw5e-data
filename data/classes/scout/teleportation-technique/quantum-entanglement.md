_**Teleportation Technique:** 11th level_
When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.
