_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You can use your ingenuity to bolster yourself or an ally. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:
- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a short or long rest.
- Roll a d4. The creature regains a number of tech points equal to the result. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a long rest.
You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
