_**Mastermind Technique:** 3rd level_
You can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against the target of your Ranger's Quarry.
Additionally, once per round, when you hit the target of your Ranger's Quarry with a tech attack, or it fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can deal additional damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry damage die of the same type as the tech power's damage.
