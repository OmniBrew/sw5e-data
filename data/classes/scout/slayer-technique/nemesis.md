_**Slayer Technique:** 11th level_
When you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points on your turn, you can use your bonus action to force one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns it repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
