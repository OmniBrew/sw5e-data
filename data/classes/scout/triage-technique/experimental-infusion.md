_**Triage Technique:** 11th level_
When you target a creature with your Ranger's Quarry, you can grant one of the following additional effects of your choice:
- ***Adrenaline/Tranquilizer.*** The creature's movement speed is doubled until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, it gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn.
- ***Focus/Dizziness.*** The creature has either advantage or disadvantage (your choice) on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute.
- ***Toughen/Weaken.*** The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your scout level, which last for 1 minute. Alternatively, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to your scout level and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.
You can use each feature once. You regain any expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.
