_**Deadeye Technique:** 11th, 13th, and 17th level_
You have learned that the person who shoots first is often the one who walks out alive. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that has not yet acted during your first turn in combat and you have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once. Additionally, on a hit, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type as the weapon. This damage increases to 1d10 at 13th level and 1d12 at 17th level.
