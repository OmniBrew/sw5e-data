- At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one).
- When you use your Hunting Party feature and the target of the attack is your Ranger's Quarry, your ally gains a bonus to damage on the attack equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.
