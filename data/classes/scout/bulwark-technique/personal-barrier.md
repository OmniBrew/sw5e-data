_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_
You gain access to a powerful personal barrier. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, you create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a short or long rest. That barrier has hit points equal to twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.
Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, your barrier regains hit points equal to the number of tech points spent.
Additionally, for as long as your barrier has hit points, you gain the following benefits:
- You are considered proficient in Constitution saving throws for the purpose of maintaining concentration on tech powers.
- Hostile creatures that hit you with melee attacks take energy damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
