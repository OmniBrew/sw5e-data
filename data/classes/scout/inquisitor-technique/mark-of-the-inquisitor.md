_**Inquisitor Technique:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_
When the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature is within 15 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever the creature casts a force power, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, the casting is disrupted, the force power fails, and the force points are wasted.
- Whenever the creature starts its turn while concentrating on a force power, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, it loses concentration on the power.
The radius of this feature increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.
