_**Inquisitor Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_
You have learned secrets from a subtle attunement to the force. Choose two force powers of no higher level than your Max Power Level, as shown in the scout table. The chosen powers count as tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the scout table.
You learn two additional powers at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of no higher level than your Max Power Level.
