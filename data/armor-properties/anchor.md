A shield with this property can be used to provide cover. As an action, you can anchor or recover the shield. While anchored, you gain no benefit from a shield, and it does not require the use of a hand. Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a heavy shield provides three-quarters cover.
