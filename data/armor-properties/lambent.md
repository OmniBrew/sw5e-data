While wielding a shield with this property, you can use a bonus action to activate or deactivate the shield's light. While active, the shield sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the shield's light is active that rely on sight have disadvantage.
