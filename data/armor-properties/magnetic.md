While you are wielding a shield with this property and a melee weapon attack misses you by an amount less than or equal to your bonus to AC from your shield, the attacking creature must make a Strength check, DC equal to the magnetic number. On a failed save, the creature's weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed.
