When you take damage while wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, you gain a charge. You can store a maximum number of charges equal to the charging number, and the charges last for 1 minute. The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack while you have charges, you deal additional damage of the same type as the weapon's damage equal to the number of charges stored, and the charges are expended.
