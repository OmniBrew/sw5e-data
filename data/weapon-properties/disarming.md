name: Disarming

When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the disarming property against a creature that is holding an object, you can attempt to disarm the target (no action required). If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or it drops an object of your choice at its feet.
