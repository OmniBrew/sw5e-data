When you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the reckless property, you can choose to gain a penalty to AC up to the reckless number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as youâ€™re holding the weapon.
