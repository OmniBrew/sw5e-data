Weave armor was constructed from a mesh of metal or composite plates and a padded jumpsuit. Variants of the armor included less plates and more padding for a lighter, though less protect-ive armor, and heavier plating with molded pieces to fit the wearer. Though the armor was available unmodified, most users personalized their armor.
