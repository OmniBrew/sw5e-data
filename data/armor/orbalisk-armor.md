This armor has no weight and does not affect encumbrance. While wearing it, you are considered proficient regardless of whether or not you have proficiency with heavy armor, and you are resistant to all unenhanced damage.

***Cursed.*** You can not remove this armor without first killing the orbalisks. While wearing this armor, whenever you complete a long rest, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. You can choose to fail this saving throw. For each saving throw you fail, the size of your Hit Die is reduced by one step (from d12 to d10, from d10 to d8, from d8 to d6, from d6 to d4, or from d4 to d2). If you fail a saving throw while your Hit Die is a d2, you die as the orbalisks consume you. Additionally, for each saving throw you fail, your AC increases by 1. For each saving throw you succeed, the size of your Hit Die increases by one step (from d2 to d4, from d4 to d6, from d6 to d8, from d8 to d10, or from d10 to d12). Additionally, for each saving throw you succeed, your AC decreases by 1. The size of your Hit Die can not exceed the Hit Dice granted by your class, and your AC can not be increased or reduced more than the number of Hit Die increases or reductions. 

_This armor is comprised of a series of small parasitic creatures called orbalisks. Over time, orbalisks reproduce until they cover the entirety of their host._
