_**Requires attunement**_
While wearing this armor, you are considered proficient regardless of whether or not you have proficiency in medium armor. Additionally, it grants a +1 bonus to AC.

***Jensaarai Regalia.*** While wearing and attuned to this armor and Jensaarai Cloak, you are adapted to both hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Additionally, this armor now grants a +2 bonus to AC, instead of +1. While wearing and attuned to this armor, Jensaarai Cloak, and Jensaarai Headgear, this armor now grants a +3 bonus to AC, instead of +2.

_At the height of their training, Jensaarai craft and bond with their own armor. While each set of armor is unique to its bearer, they share similar traits._
