name: Shoving and Tripping
type: action
---
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature to push it away from you, or to trip a creature to knock it prone. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your shove or trip must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either shove the target 5 feet away from you or trip it prone.
