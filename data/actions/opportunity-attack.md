You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your
reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack
against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t 
provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something unwillingly moves 
you without using your movement, action, bonus action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke 
an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to 
fall past an enemy. However, you do provoke an opportunity attack if a power such as force jump, 
or an ally’s Formation fighting style feature, causes you to move out of an enemies’ reach, unless 
that feature says otherwise.
