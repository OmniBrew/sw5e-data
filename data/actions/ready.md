Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To
do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the
start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the
action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in
response to it. Examples include  Examples include “If the soldier steps on the trapdoor, I’ll 
pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the gamorrean steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or
ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a power, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction 
when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the 
power’s effect requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the power 
dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the knight speed power and ready 
shock, your knight speed power ends, and if you take damage before you release shock with your reaction, your 
concentration might be broken.
