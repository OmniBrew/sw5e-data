Your Intelligence (Piloting) check measures your ability to control vehicles, aircraft, and spaceships. Piloting governs your ability to maneuver through tight spaces and debris fields or dogfight with enemy craft.
If you're driving a vehicle you're familiar with, the GM might ask you to make a or Decterity (Piloting)
check to make a difficult maneuver or avoid heavy weapon fire, crash land, or weave between traffic.
 However, if you are unfamiliar with a vehicle, the GM would require a Intelligence (Piloting)
check to see if you can pilot the vehicle at all.
