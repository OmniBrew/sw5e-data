You are a skilled gambler who spends most of your time in casinos, bar rooms, and gambling dens. Are your activities legal, or do you break the law? Have you ever cheated in a game, or do you play by the rules? No matter what, your life has been one of excitement, chance, and danger.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Sleight of Hand

__Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a set of dice, a deck of playing cards, a lucky charm, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr.

__Feature: Let's Make It Interesting__
You can convince nearly anyone to put up something they aren't normally willing to part with (property or information) in a game of chance. Your GM might rule that they will only agree to a game of their choosing, and they may only agree if they feel the odds are in their favor.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
