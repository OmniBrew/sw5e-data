You are a Jensaarai, a Force user who has come to understand the failings of both Jedi inactivity and Sith malevolence. While they wield lightsabers, a true mark of skill among the Jensaarai is the crafting of their armor. Each suit is perfectly unique to the wearer, and is frequently (but not always) adorned and shaped to represent an animal that the Jensaarai finds kinship with, up to and potentially including additional mounted weapons or sensors to further emulate that creature.

While the Jensaarai train in, and will use dark side powers when necessary, they seek to avoid true corruption. They are not evil, nor are they wholly good either. They are anti-heroes, and well-practiced in this craft. In addition, the Jensaarai train in more than the lightsaber, employing whatever tools are at hand to best fit the job.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Insight, Intimidation, Lore, and Perception

__Equipment__. A set of common clothes including a robe, a sturdy knife, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: Depths of Duality__
Due to the corruption of the Jedi training done to the pre-Jensaarai, you have a unique insight into both the Light and Dark side of the Force, as well as its history, applications, and techniques in a scholarly manner.

You are well versed in the above concepts, and can recall key information related to them. However, if the research was hidden from the public and you have not had experience working with it, you can only partially understand it. You also recognize well-known Jedi Masters and Sith Lords by their works and marks.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
