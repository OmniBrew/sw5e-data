In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.

You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in Coruscant's upper echelons, or perhaps you traveled in Nar Shaddaa's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of factions, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries on Dromund Kaas, or you might have grown up on some other affluent planet.

Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.
