Your duty is to uphold the law. Before becoming an adventurer you resided over a court or tribunal, managing proceedings and sentencing criminals to punishments fit for their crimes. Your job required a deep understanding of the law which you used to resolve conflicts both clear-cut and morally grey.

The legal system on the planet where you worked has a large effect on how you view the law. Was it a court system with a jury making the final verdict, or did you have absolute authority over determining guilt and sentencing? Was it a fair legal system with plenty of integrity, or was it rife with abuse and corruption? Did you work on criminal cases, civil law, or something even more specific? Perhaps instead of working for a government you were a judge in an internal tribunal for a temple or military organization. 

Consider what compelled you to leave your old occupation behind and begin adventuring. Perhaps you seek to bring someone beyond the scope of law to justice, or maybe you have lost faith in the legal system altogether and have turned to a vigilante approach. 

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Performance, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. Documentation of your station, a book of law, a formal uniform you wear to court, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr.

__Feature: Legal Authority__
You are familiar with the letter of the law and workings of courts, at least on the planet that you were a judge in. If you are in a foreign place where you are not familiar with their exact laws, you often will be able to track down the resources you need to learn them. 

If you or your party gets into legal trouble, your experience may help you get out of it. If you can prove your credentials, you might be able to represent your party in a court of law without admonishment. You may know of legal loopholes that will help your case. If you are in the region where you originally worked, you might have past connections with many legal professionals there.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
