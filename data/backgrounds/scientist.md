Nothing excites you more than pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Most of your time is spent in a lab performing experiments to further your interests. Few people understand the work you do. You can solve complex problems most people can't begin to wrap their heads around, and can solve simple problems in unexpected ways that surprise most people. 

What is your scientific field of interest? Is it your insatiable curiousity, or a personal goal that drives you? Did you leave your lab voluntarily, or were you kicked out? One thing is for sure - there are too many interesting research ideas, and too little time.


__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Lore, Medicine, Nature, and Technology

__Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a datapad, a book on your field of research, a pouch containing 100 cr

__Feature: Scientific Method__
You are well acquainted with your field of research from having read numerous journals or having attended scientific conferences. Concepts that are complicated, involving technical jargon that usually goes over most people's heads, are simple to you. You fully understand concepts, can recall key information, and know how to use equipment related to your field, unless the research was hidden from the public, in which case you may only partially understand it. You also recognize well-known figures in your field.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
