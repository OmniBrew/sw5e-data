You are a member of the Blackguard: a reclusive sect of Force users from the planet of Mustafar. Rather than being determined by the Force, the Blackguard believe that the light or dark dwell within the user, and that to truly increase one's knowledge and strength in the Force, one must understand and seek out the philosophies and abilities of other Force traditions around the galaxy.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Lore, and Survival

__Equipment__. A copy of a Force-wielder organization's text, a trinket from your travels around the galaxy, a set of common clothes including a robe, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
