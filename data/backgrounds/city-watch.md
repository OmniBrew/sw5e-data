You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime and wildlife. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.

Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own law enforcement forces.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Investigation, and Perception

__Equipment__. A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 100 cr

__Feature: Watcher's Eye__
Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
