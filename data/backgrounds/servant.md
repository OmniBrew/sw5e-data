You have lived much of your life in the service of a lord, noble, merchant, or someone else with much wealth or power. You fetched their coats, drove their chariots, pressed their clothes; and generally did what they asked you to do. 

Were you a highly respected butler? A simple scullery maid? Were you born into service, or did you join later? Were you close to your master or masters, or were they distant and cold? Did they treat you well, or beat you at the drop of a hat? 

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Insight, Lore, Performance, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. A noble symbol representing your employer, a set of artisan's implements (one of your choice), a set of nice clothes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr
