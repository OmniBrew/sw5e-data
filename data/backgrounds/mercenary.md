As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. 

Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Investigation, Persuasion, and Piloting

__Equipment__. A uniform of your company (traveler's clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set (one of your choice), and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (100 cr)

__Feature: Mercenary Life__
You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the cantinas and feasthalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language, and if you spend at least an hour in such a location you can come across one of the following bits of information: a job offer, significant rumor, referral to a skilled merchant, blacksmith, etc., or a hint towards the pursuit of your current quest. Additionally, you can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
