A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your A Champion Well Known feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainmentï¿½perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. 

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, and Performance

__Equipment__. A trophy earned via some sort of competition, clothing suitable to your profession, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: A Champion Well Known__
You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
