You lived in seclusion�either in a community or alone�for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Animal Handling, Lore, Medicine, and Nature

__Equipment__. A diary of your experiences, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, a bioanalysis kit, and 50 cr

__Feature: Discovery__
The seclusion of your hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. You might have discovered a great truth about the cosmos or the Force, a fact that has long been forgotten, a relic of the past that could rewrite history, or a place unseen for ages. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society. Work with your GM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.
