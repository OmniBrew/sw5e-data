You have always had a way with people. You can tease out their heart's desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage. You know what people want and you promise to deliver, coaxing people into otherwise foolish decisions. You make the improbable sound plausible, and come ahead on every deal.


__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Sleight of Hand

__Equipment__. A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, a memento of a former con, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: False Identity__
You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona.

Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
