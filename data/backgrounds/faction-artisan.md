You are a member of an artisan's faction, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your faction, until you became a master in your own right.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Persuasion, and Technology

__Equipment__. A set of tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your faction, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: Faction Membership__
As an established and respected member of a faction, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow faction members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a factionhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

factions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. You must pay dues of 50 cr per month to the faction. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.
