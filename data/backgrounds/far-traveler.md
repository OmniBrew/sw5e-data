Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter throughout the galaxy have one thing in common: they live  their lives without traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.

You aren't one of those folk.

You are from a distant place that few of the common folk realize exists; chances are good that even if some people have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and maybe a few outrageous stories. 

Although you find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be, to you, new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Perception, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. One set of traveler's clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland, a small piece of jewelry worth 100 cr in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 50 cr

__Feature: All Eyes On You__
Your foreign nature attracts attention, yielding access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
