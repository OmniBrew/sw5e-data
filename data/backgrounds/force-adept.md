You are keenly attuned to the flow of the mysterious energy field known as the Force.  With proper training, you could learn to consciously sense and manipulate that energy further.  As it is, you may appear to have heightened senses, extremely quick reflexes, an intuitive understanding of others, or an uncanny ability to persuade people to your way of thinking. Your powers may have lain dormant for a long time, perhaps you felt something inside of you but never knew what it was. Perhaps your abilities were awoken by a strong encounter with another force-sensitive with the powers of the Force, or an object associated with the Force, such as a lightsaber.


__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Deception, Insight, Perception, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a sturdy knife, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

When you attempt to learn a piece of knowledge, you often instinctively know where or from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a seemingly random person, book, or data file. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
