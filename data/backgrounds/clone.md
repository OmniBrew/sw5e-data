You are a miracle of science. A creature born not from love or passion, but from logic and machinery. Created in a laboratory, you are a perfect genetic replica of your DNA-Donor, whomever that is. 

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Lore, Sleight of Hand and Survival

__Equipment__. A set of clothes appropriate to your duties, a trinket related to your DNA-donor, and 150 credits

__Feature: A Life Not Lived__
Being a clone, you were born from the existence of another. Flashes of deeds you never did, of people you have never met and of information you have never learned sporadically appear. You may be confused with your DNA-Donor by others, being befriended by, or made enemies of, people you have never before met. The exact nature of these revelations depends on the nature of your DNA-Donor; they might lead to a site that only one other has ever seen, some long-forgotten fact, relic or weapon from the past that could reshape the present, or even information that would be damaging to the people who created you.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
