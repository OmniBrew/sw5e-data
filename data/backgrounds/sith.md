You are an acolyte of the Sith Order: an ancient order of Force-wielders devoted to the dark side of the Force. Emerging as a divergent faction to the Jedi Order, the Sith are mortal enemies of the Jedi and fight against them. Driven by emotions such as hate, anger, and greed, the Sith are deceptive and ultimately obsessed with amassing power no matter the cost. You follow the Sith Code:

*"Peace is a lie. There is only passion.
Through passion I gain strength.
Through strength I gain power.
Through power I gain victory.
Through victory my chains are broken.
The Force shall free me."*

__Feature: Feared__
As a Sith, you instill fear in those who are aware of your standing. When you are in a civilized environment, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a cantina or cutting through doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.
