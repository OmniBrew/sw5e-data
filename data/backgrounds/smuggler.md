You have spent your life hiding in the darkness, making shady deals behind closed doors. What led you to engage in a life of crime? Do you crave the thrill of lawbreaking, or did you enter the profession to pay off a debt, risking your hide on behalf of a less than honorable noble? A smuggler is an individual trained in the art of acquisition, a professional thug who can deliver anything... for a price. Smugglers tend to be bolder criminals than most, preferring bribery or distraction over subterfuge and stealth.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Deception, Piloting, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

__Equipment__. A fusion cutter, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: Careful Selection__
Some close brushes with the law have taught you that not every city guard can be bribed, and some people are simply too keen to miss minute discrepancies. This feature allows you to study a person and gain insight into whether or not they would accept a bribe, or to pick up on whether they are exceptionally more perceptive than you. It does not reveal how expensive a bribe may be for a given situation, however.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
