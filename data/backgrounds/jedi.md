You are a devout follower of the Jedi Order: an ancient, monastic peacekeeping organization united in its observance of the light side of the Force. A noble order of protectors noted for their ability to tap into the power of the Force, the Jedi serve as guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. You follow the Jedi Code:

*"There is no emotion, there is peace.
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no passion, there is serenity.
There is no chaos, there is harmony.
There is no death, there is the Force."*


__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Lore, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. A copy of the Jedi code, a set of common clothes including a robe, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: Shelter of the Faithful__
As a Jedi, you command the respect of those who are loyal to the Jedi Order. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at any Jedi temple, and those who support your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific Jedi temple and have a residence there. This could be the temple where you trained, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the Jedi for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
