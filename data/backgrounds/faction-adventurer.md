Adventuring is nothing new to you. Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life. Maybe you were part of an adventuring band previously, but split with them after a disagreement or tragedy. Or, perhaps you worked around heroes in a lesser role for most of your young life, and you are now ready to graduate to the front lines.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Investigation, Nature, and Survival

__Equipment__. 50 feet of rope, a small knife, a trophy, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr.

__Feature: Faction Membership__
You are an established and respected member of an adventurer's faction, allowing you to rely on certain benefits that membership provides. If you are in a town with a headquarters for your adventurer's faction and you are in good standing with the faction, you will be allowed to look at the job postings and find adventuring work to earn money. 

factions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. You must pay dues of 50 cr per month to the faction. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.
