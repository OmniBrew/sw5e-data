Instead of an artisans' faction, you might belong to a faction of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others. Your faction might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the galaxy. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. A letter of introduction from your faction, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: Faction Membership__
As an established and respected member of a faction, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow faction members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a factionhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

factions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. You must pay dues of 50 cr per month to the faction. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
