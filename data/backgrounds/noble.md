You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with manual labor, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land.

Work with your GM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries, as well as your family and their influence on you. Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, how do people regard them?

What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family or the head itself? Are you far down the line of succession? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces? 

Does your family have a coat of arms you might wear, a signet ring, or particular colors? 

These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.


__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Deception, Insight, Lore, and Persuasion

__Equipment__. A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a letter of pedigree, and a purse containing 250 cr

__Feature: Position of Privilege__
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
