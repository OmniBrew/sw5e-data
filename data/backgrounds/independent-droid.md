You were once a machine, designed for a very specific task, with no mind of your own. You followed orders, never questioning the tasks assigned to you, often the mundane tasks nobles didn't want to waste time doing themselves. However, something happened in your existence that changed your programming, freeing you from your life of obedience. 

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Medicine, Persuasion, or Technology

__Equipment__. Astrotech's implements, one trinket from before you awoke, and a belt pouch containing 50 cr

__Feature: Deviant Knowledge__
When you served under a master, you would often hear secrets that weren't meant for your ears. Back then, however, you weren't alive. You have insider knowledge on your previous owner or perhaps others who passed through your area. This knowledge may be used for leverage, revenge, or other means, at the discretion of your GM. This knowledge, while it may prove useful in your adventure, may also make you a target for those whose secrets you possess.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
