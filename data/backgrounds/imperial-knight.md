You are an Imperial Knight, a Force-wielding protector of the Fel Empire. Your order combines the teachings of the Jedi with the creed of the Royal Guard of old, using the Force as a powerful and respected tool with which to serve the Force as embodied by your Emperor. Imperial Knights do not share the philosophies of the Jedi with regards to the Force and its light side, and are well aware of the dangers of the dark side, dutifully rejecting its use and temptations. 

While Imperial Knights wield and construct their own lightsabers, they assign them no ceremonial value, treating them as nothing more than tools. As such, almost all lightsabers of the Imperial Knights look the same, with uniform hilt design and signature silver blades. These blades are produced by synthetic crystals similar to the red variety used by the Sith, created with knowledge from Emperor Palpatine's *Book of Anger*, but in a process bereft of the dark side. Imperial Knights are also recognized by their crimson armor emblazoned with the insignia of the Empire and ideally crafted of lightsaber-resistant materials.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Piloting

__Equipment__. a revised copy of the *Book of Anger*, an Imperial insignia, a black cape with a hood, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr

__Feature: Will of the Emperor__
The authority granted by your position is easily acknowledged even by those who don't recognize the Imperial Knights. Though they might not know you, common citizens will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.
