You have a need for speed.  You live off of the adrenaline rush of piloting your craft or steering your beast through the dangers of a race.  You love the thrill of a photo-finish and relish the sweet taste of victory.

__Skill Proficiencies__. Choose two from Animal Handling, Nature, Piloting, and Technology

__Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a trophy or ribbon from your first-ever win, a gaming set (one of your choice), and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

__Feature: Terrain Mastery__
You have a preternatural instinct for understanding the terrain, interpreting maps, and planning routes.  You and your party can move at three-fourths your speed over difficult terrain during long-distance travel.  Because of these skills, if you know your destination and the intervening terrain--either by reputation, by sight, or by maps you have seen--you are able to identify an effective short-cut, trimming your travel time by up to half.  Your GM may rule that your short-cut entails significant danger or may be temporarily impassable.


__BACKGROUND FEAT__. As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:
