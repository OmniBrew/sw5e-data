You can use your psychic aura to influence individuals of both sexes. Whenever you roll a 1 on a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.
