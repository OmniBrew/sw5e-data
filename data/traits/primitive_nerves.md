Because of their primitive nervous systems, tognath are immune to most pain, letting them shrug off major injuries. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
