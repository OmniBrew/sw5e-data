Due to your carapace and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your carapace provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.
