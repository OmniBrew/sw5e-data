Your sharp teeth and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special claw attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.
