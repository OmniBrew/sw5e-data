As an action, you can expel ink in a 10-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
