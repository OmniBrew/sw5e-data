Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can perform a special pressure point attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack�s normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn, and you can�t use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.
