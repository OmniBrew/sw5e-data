__Mounted Style.__ You are skilled at fighting while mounted. You gain the following benefits:
- Mounting a vehicle or beast only uses 5 feet of your movement, provided you can reach it.
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead, provided you are a valid target for that attack.
