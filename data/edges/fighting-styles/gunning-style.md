__Gunning Style.__ You are skilled at using blasters in unique ways. You gain the following benefits:
- When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against your burst or rapid property, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.
- When you use the burst property of a weapon, you can instead spray a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide within range with shots. 
- When you use the rapid property of a weapon, when you roll the weapon's damage dice twice, you can double one set of the weapon's damage dice and forgo the other instead of adding them together.
