__Disruption Style.__ Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You are skilled at fighting and interfering with casters of the chosen type. You gain the following benefits:
- When you force a creature to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on your turn, and they succeed on the save, you can use your bonus action to force them to reroll the save. They must use the new roll.
- Once per round, when a hostile creature attempts to cast a power while within 5 feet of you, they must first make a Constitution saving throw as if to maintain concentration (DC = 10 + the power's level). On a failure, the power isn't cast and any points are wasted.
