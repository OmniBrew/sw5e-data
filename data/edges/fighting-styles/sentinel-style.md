__Sentinel Style.__ You are skilled at techniques that take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard. You gain the following benefits:
- Creatures provoke an opportunity attack when they move to within your reach or move 5 feet or greater while within your reach.
- When you hit a creature that is no more than one size larger than you with an opportunity attack, the creature gains 4 slowed levels until the end of the current turn.
