__Defense Style.__ You are skilled at the art of defending yourself. You gain the following benefits:
- While you are wearing medium or heavy armor with which you are proficient, you can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, damage dealt to you by the target is reduced by an amount equal to half your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of one) while marked. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to avoid being moved.
