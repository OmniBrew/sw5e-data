__Great Weapon Style.__ You are skilled at putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
- While you are wielding a two-handed light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, your weapon damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.
- Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.
