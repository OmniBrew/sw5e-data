__Sharpshooter Style.__ You are skilled with firing at distant targets. You gain the following benefits:
- You can use your bonus action to mark a target greater than 30 feet from you that you can see. If you do so, and that target moves at least 5 feet before the start of your next turn, they provoke an opportunity attack from you, and you can make a ranged weapon attack with a blaster weapon for that opportunity attack.
- Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against targets greater than 30 feet from you. If the target has one-quarter cover, you ignore it entirely.
- Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.
