__Explosives Style.__ You are skilled at fighting with explosives. You gain the following benefits:
- You can throw grenades and set mines with your bonus action, instead of your action. If you could already throw grenades and set mines as a bonus action, you can instead do so as a reaction on your turn.
- When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against a grenade, mine, or missile you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.
