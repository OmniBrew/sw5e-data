__Twin-Blade Style.__ You are skilled at fighting with double-bladed weapons. You gain the following benefits:
- When you engage in Double-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the attack roll of your Double-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.
- Grasping a double weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.
