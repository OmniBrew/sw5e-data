__Snapshot Style.__ You are skilled at getting up close and personal. You gain the following benefits:
- You no longer have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks due to being within 5 feet of a hostile creature.
- Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against targets within 30 feet of you. If the target has one-quarter cover, you ignore it entirely.
- Your blaster weapon damage rolls against creatures within 30 feet of you gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.
- Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.
