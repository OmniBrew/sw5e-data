__Secured Style.__ You are skilled at fighting with weapons in atypical places. You gain the following benefits:
- At the start of each of your turns while wielding a fixed weapon, you can choose to treat the weapon as a light shield until the start of your next turn. If you do so, you can't make attacks with the weapon for the duration.
- You can benefit from fixed weapons while the hand is full.
