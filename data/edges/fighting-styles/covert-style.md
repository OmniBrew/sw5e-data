__Covert Style.__ You are skilled at fighting from unseen angles. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Hide action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Hide action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
- Creatures you've dealt damage to since the start of your last turn have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find you.
