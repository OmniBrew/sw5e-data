__Spotting Style.__ You are skilled at keeping track of your surroundings. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Search action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Search action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
- You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to determine the nature of illusions. If you would already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.
