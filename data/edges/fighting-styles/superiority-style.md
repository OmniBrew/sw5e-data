__Superiority Style.__ You are skilled at utilizing maneuvers to enhance your skills on the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn one maneuver, detailed in Chapter 13. Your maneuver ability is Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. 
- You gain one superiority die, which is a d4. This die changes as you gain levels: to d6 at 5th level, to d8 at 9th level, to d10 at 13th level, and to d12 at 17th level. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
