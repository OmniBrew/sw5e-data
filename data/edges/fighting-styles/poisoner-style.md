__Poisoner Style.__ You are skilled at with the subtlety of poisons. You gain the following benefits:
- You can apply poisons with your bonus action, instead of your action. If you could already apply poisons as a bonus action, you can instead do so as a reaction on your turn.
- When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against a poison you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.
