__Berserk Style.__ You are skilled at returning pain to those who deliver it. You gain the following benefits: 
- When you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you deal additional damage equal to your Strength modifier if that creature dealt damage to you since the start of your last turn.
- When you choose to let an attack that would miss you hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.
