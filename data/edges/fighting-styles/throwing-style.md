__Throwing Style.__ You are skilled with the techniques of throwing weapons. You gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can immediately draw another weapon.
- Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
- When you miss with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against a creature within 15 feet and behind your initial target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.
