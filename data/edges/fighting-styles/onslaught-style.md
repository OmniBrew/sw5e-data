__Onslaught Style.__ You are skilled at using your momentum to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Dash action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Dash action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
- When you would make an ability check to attempt to shove or trip a creature, you can make a melee weapon attack against the target's AC instead of a contested check. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack roll with advantage.
