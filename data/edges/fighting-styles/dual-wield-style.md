__Dual Wield Style.__ You are skilled at fighting with two weapons. You gain the following benefits:
- When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage roll of your Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.
- You can draw or stow two weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
