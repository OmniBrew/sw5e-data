__Assisting Style.__ You are skilled at enabling your allies. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Help action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Help action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
- Creatures benefiting from your Help action can't have disadvantage on the affected ability check or attack roll.
