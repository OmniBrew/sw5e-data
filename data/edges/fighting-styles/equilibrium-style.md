__Equilibrium Style.__ You are skilled at fighting without the confines of armor. You gain the following benefits:
- While you are wearing light or no armor and not wielding a shield, you can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, you gain a bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against effects the target controls equal to half your Dexterity modifier (minimum of +1) while marked. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
- You have advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being moved.
