      You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and on its turn must use its movement to move half its speed in a random direction. Roll a d8 and assign a direction to each face. If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.
