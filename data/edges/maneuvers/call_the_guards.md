      When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die and command a willing ally within 5 feet of that creature to use their reaction to intercede. The creature is then forced to make an attack on the ally instead. If the attack misses, the ally can immediately make a weapon attack against that creature as a part of that same reaction. Roll the superiority die, and add the result to the ally's attack roll.
