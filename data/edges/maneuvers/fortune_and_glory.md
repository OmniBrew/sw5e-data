      When you would make a weapon attack against a target within 30 feet, you can instead manipulate the Force to expend a superiority die and make a Sleight of Hand check using your universal forcecasting ability to plant something on the target, conceal an object on the target, lift the target's purse, or take something from its pocket. Roll the superiority die, and add the result to the check.
