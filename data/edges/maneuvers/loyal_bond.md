      Whenever you are hit with an attack, you can expend one superiority die to command your companion to immediately use its reaction and move up to its speed directly towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, roll the superiority die. Your companion takes the damage instead of you, subtracting the amount you rolled from the total.
