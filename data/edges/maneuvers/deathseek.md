      When an attack made against a hostile creature that you can see would miss, you can use a reaction and expend a superiority die and roll it to force the creature to instead take the hit. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the minimum damage the attack could have dealt plus additional damage equal to the result of the superiority die.
