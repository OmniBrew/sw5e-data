When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.
