When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures
from the powerâ€™s full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds
on its saving throw against the power.
